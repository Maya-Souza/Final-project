    these are the places that are the subject of this analysis: 
    - **2018: Thailand, Pakistan and Mexico.** Since Bangkok is in Thailand, I decided to be more generalistic
    - **2019: Thailand, India and Pakistan**
    - **2020: Thailand, Tabriz and India**
    - **2021: Thailand, California and Arizona.** Santa Monica and Los Angeles are in California and America is too broad 
    (a whole continent!), so I got the sixth place on the list which was Arizona. 
    The reason why I decided to take into consideration these two states separately instead of doing the same 
    I did for Thailand-Bangkok is because the USA is way bigger than Thailand and has a very large volume of tourism in these 
    two states independently
