Hungary is a Central European country with a population of 10 million people. Despite the country's high standard of living, while the average number of people living below the poverty line in the EU is 17 percent, it is 14.6 percent in Hungary. Ethnic Hungarians are a mix of Finno-Ugric Magyars and various Turkic, Slavic, and Germanic peoples who have assimilated. Ethnic minority groups make up a small proportion of the population. The Roma is the largest of these. Hungary is a Central European country with a landlocked border.  The Danube River divides its capital, Budapest. Its cityscape is dotted with architectural landmarks ranging from Buda's medieval Castle Hill to Pest's grand neoclassical buildings along Andrássy Avenue to the 19th-century Chain Bridge. The popularity of mineral spas, including at thermal Lake Hévz, is a result of Turkish and Roman influence on Hungarian culture. Hungary is one of the most popular countries in Eastern Europe, and it is known for its castles, beautiful countryside, interesting culture with a rich history, and delicious food. Hungary is also the home of the beautiful blue Danube River, and no trip here is complete without a boat ride. If you want to explore the secrets and treasures of this country, here are 10 best places to visit in Hungary.

It’s not the capital city of Turkey, but is known as the country’s economic, cultural and historic center. There are many historical places to visit as well as lots of interesting art, architecture, culinary heritage, and a vibrant local atmosphere. Try to stay at least 3 to 5 days in this bustling city to be able to enjoy the many things to do. In this video we'll highlight 7 INCREDIBLE things to do in Istanbul, Turkey!

7. Istiklal Street 
The 7th best thing to do in Istanbul is to explore the vibrant Istiklal Street. Istiklal is the busiest street in the city, comparable to Oxford Street in London or Fifth Avenue in New York City. This long stretch has a wide range of shops, cafes, restaurants, and much more.

6. “Relax” at a Hamam
The Turkish bath, or hamam, is an important part of Turkish culture. It’s a type of steam bath and also a place of public bathing that was used primarily within the Ottoman Empire starting in the 16th century. There are about 60 baths in Istanbul, offering just the traditional bath or including massages. The price can range from $15 to $50. 
 
5. Galata Bridge & Bosphorus 
The 5th best thing to do in Istanbul is to walk the Galata Bridge in the heart of Istanbul. This bridge spans the Golden Horn and stretches between modern Istanbul on the north and the Old Town of Istanbul on the south. The Golden Horn is actually an inlet of the Bosphorus river, which forms the border between the European and the Asian continent. 
 
4. Topkapi Palace
Topkapi Palace is an architectural highlight in Istanbul and therefore ranks at number 4. Home to the Ottoman sultans for nearly 400 years, this palace was the heart of the vast Ottoman Empire. The palace has hundreds of rooms decorated with beautiful tiles, gold, and other decorations.

3. Galata Tower 
The 3rd best thing to do in Istanbul is to visit the Galata Tower. This historic tower sits high above the city and is visible from all angles. It was once used as a watchtower, but is now converted into a museum. It offers the best view of Istanbul!

2. Shop at the Grand & Spice Bazaar 
The runner-up activity is to shop at the Grand Bazaar and the Spice Bazaar. Both are located in the old town of Istanbul, near the Galata Bridge. The Spice Bazaar is a giant covered market with the majority of shops selling food. The market is also close to the Grand Bazaar, which is the true centre of hustle and bustle. With over 4,000 shops, the Grand Bazaar has a little bit of everything. 

Hagia Sophia + Free  Walking Tour
The best thing to do in Istanbul is to visit the Hagia Sophia. Located in the heart of Sultanahmet, this is one of the most impressive and important buildings ever constructed. It’s now free to enter, but to fully understand the importance of this building we encourage you to go on a “free walking tour”. Free walking tours run daily at 10:30AM.

Southeast Asia is a group of diverse countries between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, featuring indigenous cultures influenced by Indian, Chinese and Western culture. It has long been a favorite corner of the world for globe-tramping backpackers, known for its perfect beaches, tasty cuisine and low prices. The region represents a totally different culture for Western travelers. Instead of cathedrals, they’ll find temples.

From Scandinavia's striking snow-coated scenery to the charming coastlines of the Mediterranean, Europe is full of diverse and dreamy landscapes that belie its relatively small size. While its world-class capitals of London, Paris, and Rome attract the most visitors, the continent's 44 countries each have delightfully different cities and attractions to explore.  With so many sublime sights and sensational scenery to see, visiting all of Europe's most beautiful destinations could take a lifetime.","['europe', 'europe travel', 'europe tourism', 'Picos de Europa', 'Transfagarasan Highway', 'Lapland', 'pulpit rock', 'Dolomites', 'Lake Bled', 'meteora', 'Lauterbrunnen Valley', 'beautiful places']",2020-10-15T12:37:17Z,8171852,92528,,1488,PT35M38S,true
85,8oirL3AWoV4,World Wild Hearts,"ALGARVE, PORTUGAL (2022) | 10 Incredible Places To Visit In The Algarve","The Algarve is the southernmost region of continental Portugal. Thanks to its year-round sunny weather and beautiful rugged coastline, it’s one of the most popular holiday destinations in all of Europe. In this video we highlight 10 diverse places to visit in the Algarve:

10. Sagres 
Sitting at the westernmost tip of the Algarve, Sagres is the wildest and most untamed destination. Windswept, barren landscapes, towering cliffs, and rough waters are what set this place apart. 

9. Portimão 
Visit the Portimão museum if you want to learn more about its fishing and canning tradition, or go to the medieval Fort of Santa Catarina de Ribamar for panoramic views. But the biggest draw is undoubtedly Portimão’s nearby Praia da Rocha.

8. Faro & Ria Formosa
From cobblestone streets and cozy squares to a wide range of lagoons and wetlands, Faro boasts a blend of city and nature activities. We really enjoyed a boat tour in the Ria Formosa Natural Park, which is home to canals, marshland and small islands.

☑️ Book a boat tour: https://www.getyourguide.com/faro-l1238/from-faro-ria-formosa-islands-catamaran-tour-t64208/?partner_id=57UJ5GF&utm_medium=online_publisher&placement=content-middle&cmp=Algarve_video

7. Aljezur & West Coast Beaches
With wide-open beaches and sheer sea cliffs, the West Coast of the Algarve is a true hidden gem. It’s also another prime destination for surfing. We recommend Arrifana Beach if you’re a beginner or intermediate surfer.

6. Fishermen’s Village Ferragudo
With its white houses reaching down to the river, walking around this authentic fishing town is an experience in itself. But Praia Grande is also a great place to relax and enjoy watersports. 

5. Lagos & Ponta da Piedade
Lagos has a wide range of cafés and restaurants to choose from, but also some historical sights, such as castle walls, churches, and a fort. Combine this with its spectacular coastline, filled with steep cliffs, caves, and grottoes, and you’ve got one of the most scenic destinations in the Algarve. 

🎥 Watch Lagos video: https://youtu.be/GTDZPgtlra0

4. Serra de Monchique 
Apart from beautiful beaches, the Algarve is also home to a rolling mountain range. The town of Monchique lies in pristine nature, surrounded by lush green forests. It’s an idyllic and authentic mountain town with sweeping vistas and a network of nature trails. 

☑️ Book a tour to Monchique and Silves with Algarve Jipe Safari: https://www.algarvejipesafari.com/ 

3. Silves 
This historic town cascades down the hill, flowing out from beneath the  beautiful Silves Castle (Castelo de Silves). Enjoy your time learning about the town’s history inside the castle walls as well as on the cobbled streets surrounding it.

2. The 7 Hanging Valleys
This 12km out-and-back hike takes between 4 to 6 hours to complete if you do the full route, and includes views of the Atlantic ocean as well as limestone rock formations. There is some elevation gain and loss as you climb up and down each of the valleys, but overall the hike is easy to moderate. 

1. Benagil Cave
The Benagil Cave is a world-class natural attraction in the Algarve. Although it’s only a short distance from Benagil Beach, you still need a kayak, stand up paddle board, or guided boat tour to reach the caves safely. 

☑️ Book a guided kayaking tour: https://www.getyourguide.com/carvoeiro-l2935/benagil-benagil-caves-kayaking-tour-t216270/?partner_id=57UJ5GF&utm_medium=online_publisher&placement=content-middle&cmp=Algarve_video

👕 DAVID’S BEEN HERE SHIRTS & MERCH: https://teespring.com/stores/davids-been-here

Welcome to Singapore, one of the smallest countries in the world. Singapore is an island state located off the southern tip of the Malaysian peninsula in Southeast Asia.

Besides being the world’s 2nd wealthiest country (second only to Qatar), Singapore is extremely clean and safe, boasting superior air quality and of course tons of great things to see, do and eat!

Welcome to Gardens by the Bay one of the most amazing and botanical gardens in the world. A few things you can see here is the flower dome, the cloud forest, several gardens and the supertrees.

The Supertrees are living and breathing sculptures rising above the gardens. For epic views, head up to the top of these supertrees and stroll along the 22-meter-high aerial walkway known as the Skyway to experience the Marina Bay area from a bird’s eye view.

Next up we visit China Town! It's a great place to do some souvenir shopping, eat some local Chinese food and walk around. 

One of the highlights about visiting Singapore is to eat at a hawker center. This is a huge food court full of stalls. You need to eat Indian, Malaysian and Chinese. It's very inexpensive! 

The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is one of Asia’s most iconic buildings and home to the world’s most renowned infinity pool. To visit the pool you must be a guest of the hotel, but you can experience incredible views from the Skypark observation deck or from one of the 57th floor restaurants. 

Welcome to the Singapore Zoo! It was founded in 1973, we take a quick tour through the zoo to see the asian animals. Singapore Zoo was the first zoo in the world to have free roaming orangutans.

The River Safari is located right next to the Singapore Zoo. It’s a fascinating journey through some of the world’s largest river systems like the Nile and the Mississippi. I was especially excited to visit the Giant Panda Forest.

We are inside Thian Hock Keng Temple. It was constructed in the 1840s using the best materials from China at the time. In 1973 it was declared a national monument. Admission is free! 

Orchard Road is a major tourist attraction, and when you look around it’s easy to see why. This is where you come for some serious retail therapy, and with more than 10 shopping centers, there is plenty to choose from. The 20-storey Paragon is perhaps the most famous along the strip, with stores like Gucci, Prada and Burberry. It boasts over 200 stores in all.

The Singapore Flyer is the worlds largest observation wheel. This ferris wheel has 28 capsules, each fits 28 people and it takes 28 minutes to do a complete rotation. 

Little India is where the Indian community settled in over 200 years ago. Now a days it is a commercial district. They have converted these shop houses into restaurants, shops, jewelry stores and offices. It's a great place to buy gold and try indian food! 

Singapore’s Changi Airport is second to none! You may actually want to have a layover here because of how many things there are to do – from a butterfly garden, to shopping and dining, relaxation areas, movie theatre, art installations, a swimming pool, and much much more.

Changi is my favorite airport in the world!

There you have my top 10 places to visit in Singapore! What are your favorite spots? Leave a comment below!

114,W6PT0hbD_Z4,Just Go With Amreen,What Is The Best Place To Visit In Serbia? | This Is Western Serbia | Serbia Travel Vlog 2021,"Continuing The Serbia Travel Vlog 2021 series, here's my 2 cents on What Is The Best Place To Visit In Serbia? Hands down, it is Western Serbia! Final call! I am hosting my very first group tour to Serbia. Few Spots left. https://justgowithamreen.com/new-years-eve-celebrations-in-serbia/

I grew up in dubai. It is very fast paced city. Nothing is quiet or calm. No relaxation and you barely ever hear the birds chirping. For a person like that to visit Western Serbia during off-peak season, was heaven! If you're visiting Serbia and only staying gin Belgrade, you're making a huge mistake. You must see western Serbia. You cannot miss this. Also if you ask me, best time to visit Zlatibor? its autumn. October is perfect! The season gets over mid September and October is fairly quiet. However, you'll forget blinking your eye when you see how mind numbingly gorgeous this place gets during Autumn.

I took my private tour with Republik Tours. They are based in western serbia itself and they specialize in that part of Serbia. The transportation in Western serbia isn't great. So you either need a car to explore all the places you see in the vlog or you need a tour company that can provide you with a driver and car. I cannot insist enough that you must visit this part of Serbia. You'll thank me later.

==== ABOUT LES FRENCHIES ====
After 32 years in the US, the Duponts moved to France where Antoine was born. Antoine is rediscovering his homeland and sharing it with his American wife Colleen. With the help of his brother Vincent, a renowned Restaurateur (and food snob). 

They are on a quest to find the best France has to offer. 

There are over 35,000 villages in France, all with their own history, culture, and food. We are on a journey to discover as many of them as we can together. Let’s go.

186,V86I5uWZVOc,World Wild Hearts,"OAXACA CITY, MEXICO (2022) | 10 Best Things To Do In & Around Oaxaca City","Oaxaca City is the capital of the state of Oaxaca in southwestern Mexico. It’s truly one of the best places to visit in Mexico thanks to its mix of interesting history, world-class cuisine, and colorful examples of indigenous and colonial cultures. 

10 INCREDIBLE Things To Do In & Around Oaxaca City:

10. Watch the sunset

Since Oaxaca city is surrounded by mountains, it’s possible to enjoy wonderful sunsets and sunrises here. Go to any rooftop in the city or hike up to the “Auditorio Guelaguetza” for an amazing view. 

9. Indulge in the Oaxacan Cuisine

From some of the best experimental restaurants to delicious street food, the Oaxacan cuisine is uniquely influenced by its cultural diversity. The area is best known for its 7 varieties of mole, which is a complex, sweet sauce often served with chicken and rice.

☑️  Cooking class: https://www.getyourguide.com/oaxaca-de-juarez-l681/oaxaca-traditional-oaxacan-cooking-class-with-market-visit-t388323/?partner_id=57UJ5GF&utm_medium=online_publisher&placement=content-middle&cmp=Oaxaca_video

8. Hike at Pueblos Mancomunados

About a 1.5 hour drive from Oaxaca City, you can find the Pueblos Mancomunados. We visited the largest village, named Cuajimoloyas, which was easiest to get to by local bus from Oaxaca City. There are a wide variety of outdoor activities you can do here including hiking, mountain biking, ziplining and bird watching. 

7. Visit the Local Markets 

“Mercado veinte de Noviembre” and “Mercado Benito Juárez” are great places to start and dive into the extraordinary food this area has to offer. They are both located in the historic center, just one block from the main square “Zócalo”. 

6. Visit a mezcalería

It would be a shame to visit Oaxaca and not try its most famous spirit made from agave plants. There are many mezcalerías in the city where you can taste mezcal. But for a real authentic experience, head out of town and visit one of the surrounding mezcal distilleries.

5. Day trip to Mitla 

Located about 31 miles, or 50km to the south of Oaxaca City sits the town of Mitla. Here, you can visit ruins that are of Zapotec and Mixtec origin as well as Prehistoric caves, which provided shelter for centuries with rock-art evidence from 10,000 years ago. 

4. Visit the Historic Downtown (Free Walking Tour)

The city of Oaxaca has been able to preserve its unique character thanks to its beautiful colors and interesting architecture. Every day at 10AM and 5PM you can meet a local tour guide at the Teatro Macedonio Alcalá.

☑️  Free walking tour: https://worldwildhearts.hopp.to/oaxaca-free-walking-tour

3. Join local festivities

Oaxaca is known to have some of the most incredible festivities where the creativity of the locals is expressed at its best. You can find entertainment in the city throughout the entire year. 

2. Monte Albán

The historic settlement of Monte Albán is located on a mountaintop just 8 kms, or 5miles to the west of Oaxaca City. Founded in the 6th century B.C., it functioned as the Zapotecs capital between 500 B.C. and 800 A.D. 

☑️  Monte Alban tour: https://www.getyourguide.com/oaxaca-de-juarez-l681/from-oaxaca-monte-alban-and-art-craft-towns-day-trip-t389757/?partner_id=57UJ5GF&utm_medium=online_publisher&placement=content-middle&cmp=Oaxaca_video

1. Hierve el Agua

Located 1 hour and 45 mins from Oaxaca City, Hierve el Agua is truly one of the most unique natural wonders in Mexico. You can hike to the top and the bottom of the waterfalls or freshen up at the infinity pool, which offers some amazing views of the surrounding mountains.

198,DC-wPUKLiXE,Peter and Yen,Top 11 Things to do in SAIGON (Ho Chi Minh) VIETNAM,"We went back to one of our favourite countries in the world - Vietnam! Last year we traveled through North and Central Vietnam, but this time round we visited the South, Saigon aka Ho Chi Minh.

During our time in Saigon, Vietnam, we compiled a list of 11 Top things to do in Saigon. We hope it'll give you some ideas of fun things to do and must-visit places in Ho Chi Minh.

1. MEKONG DELTA
As a first must-do activity in Saigon, we ticked off something from our Vietnam bucket list which is visiting the Mekong Delta river. Our day trip included a stop off at Vinh Trang Pagoda as well as a simple lunch at Tortoise Island (also known as Turtle Island). 

If you want to book the same tour as us you can use the link below:
https://www.klook.com/activity/2016-full-day-excursion-mekong-delta-ho-chi-minh-city/

2. ARTINUS 3D ART MUSEUM
Visiting Artinus 3D Art Museum is a fun way to spend a few hours. There are a ton of different 3D artworks to take loads of great photos. It's one of those enjoyable family-friendly top places to visit in Saigon especially if you want to create some fun memories together.

Address: Số 2 Đường số 9, Tân Hưng, Quận 7, Hồ Chí Minh, Vietnam

3. A O SHOW (SAIGON OPERA HOUSE)
If you enjoy theater productions filled with culture, acrobatics and traditional live music then visiting the Saigon Opera House in Ho Chi Minh to watch the A O Show will be right up your alley. 

You're not allowed to take photos or video the performance but we reached out to the team and were granted a special backstage sneak peak for our channel (with permission to film) before watching the full performance that night. Make sure you check when the sessions are beforehand. You can pick up your tickets from the Saigon Opera House rather than buy it online too.

Saigon Opera House
Address: 07 Công Trường Lam Sơn, Bến Nghé, Quận 1, Hồ Chí Minh 700000, Vietnam

4. CU CHI TUNNELS
A must do visit activity while visiting Saigon is checking out the Cu Chi tunnels. Vietnam was able to win various wars through genius guerrilla tactics and to be able to see the Cu Chi tunnels in real life and learn about the history of what life was like for the soldiers and Vietnamese people was super interesting.

Address: TL15, Phú Hiệp, Củ Chi, Hồ Chí Minh 733814, Vietnam

MORE INFO ABOUT THIS VIDEO 😃
⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯
Barcelona is an amazing place to eat! But here’s the thing - it can also be hard to eat well in Barcelona because it’s so touristy. There are just so many options, and lots of them literally are tourist traps. But happily there are also so many incredible places to eat and delicious things to taste and drink if you just know where to look.

In this video I take you to 10 of my favourite places to eat 10+ incredible bites.  And we visit 3 famous neighbourhoods across the entire video. We go to the Born, the Gothic Quarter and La Barceloneta - three neighbourhoods that you have to visit, and we’ll eat delicious food in each!

And a number of places are places we visit on Devour Tour’s food tours - including our Tastes & Traditions of Barcelona Food Tour and our Tapas, Taverns & History Food Tour

Also, once you’ve watched this, be sure to check out my playlist of Barcelona videos - including my epic 9-stop Barcelona Tapas Crawl.

So, where do we go?
1. Granja Dulcinea for an incredible suizo (chocolate and cream!)
2. Mercado Santa Caterina: We visit Bar Joan for a fry-up breakfast and cava and Antonio Iberics for a fantastic selection of cured meats. Plus, we visit a stall for delicious escalivada.
3. Historic Casa Gispert for a selection of wood-roasted almonds, and chocolate treats
4. Hofmann Pastisseria for an insane marscapone croissant
5. La Campana for delicious turrón and horchata
6. Xarcutería La Pineda for vermouth and a selection of potato chips with Espinaler sauce, cheeses and salt-cured anchovies
7. Bodega La Palma for patatas bravas and red wine
8. Can Paixano for a delicious butifarra sandwich and also a pork loin and cheese sandwhich - all knocked back with their famous cava
9. La Cova Fumada for a bomba (it was invented here!), grilled squid and grilled sardines
10. Can Ramonet for a delicious seafood fideuá and drinking from the porrón!

Salut!

205,Wf6K2Q7447E,World Wild Hearts,"CANCUN, MEXICO (2022) | 10 Best Things To Do in & Around Cancun","Cancun is located in the northeast on the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico and borders the Caribbean Sea. It is known for its white sand beaches, turquoise sea, numerous resorts, and nightlife. In this video we’ll show you the top 10 things to do in and around Cancun.

10. Cancun Scenic Tower
The Cancun Scenic Tower is the highest attraction in the Riviera Maya. Here, you can take a ride up to an altitude of 262 feet, or 80 meters.

9. Visit the downtown
The 9th best thing to do in Cancun is to visit the downtown area. Downtown Cancun offers a great taste of local culture, with delicious street food, small shops, and cute parks.
 
8. Swim at nearby cenotes
At number 8 we have a truly refreshing and unique experience: swimming in the nearby cenotes. The Yucatan Peninsula in general is well-known for its cenotes.

7. Relax at the Hotel Zone 
The Hotel Zone is the primary tourist area, filled with high-rise hotels, shops, bars, and restaurants. It is a 15-mile, or 24 km strip of beautiful white-sand beaches and deep blue water.

6. Cancun nightlife
Most nightclubs are located in the Hotel Zone and can get pretty wild. Coco Bongo is the most popular club in Cancun, featuring acrobats, cover bands and DJs. 

5. Explore “local” Playa Tortugas
Located along a more quiet part of the Hotel Zone, Playa Tortugas offers a more local experience, with a relaxed atmosphere and clean sands. It’s also better for swimming, as the water is calm.

4. Isla Mujeres Day Tour
The fourth best thing to do in Cancún is to go on a day trip to the nearby Isla Mujeres. Only a 20 minute boat ride from Cancun, Isla Mujeres is a peaceful paradise known for its white-sand beaches.

☑️Book Isla Mujeres Day Tour: https://www.getyourguide.com/cancun-l150/isla-mujeres-all-inclusive-catamaran-tour-t217131/?partner_id=57UJ5GF&utm_medium=online_publisher&placement=content-middle&cmp=Cancun_video

3. Hidden gem “Isla Blanca”
About 12.5miles or 20km north of the city of Cancún sits the stunning Isla Blanca. You can get here by local collectivo, which leaves near the Farmacia Canto, at the corner of Avenida López Portillo and Calle siete about 3 times a day.

2. Day trip to Chichén Itzá
A trip to Cancun isn’t complete without visiting one of the 7 World Wonders. Chichén Itzá is located about 3 hours away from Cancun by car or tour bus. It was once a vibrant city with a diverse population of Mayan people extending well into the tens of thousands. 

☑️ Book Chichen Itzá Day Tour: https://www.getyourguide.com/riviera-maya-l1099/chichen-itza-full-day-cenote-valladolid-tour-t115450/?partner_id=57UJ5GF&utm_medium=online_publisher&placement=content-middle&cmp=Cancun_video

1. Dive/snorkel at Underwater Museum & Reef
The best thing to do in Cancun in our opinion is to go scuba diving or snorkeling at the MUSA  “Underwater Museum of Art” and the Manchones Reef. Located only 30 minutes away from Cancún, this Underwater Museum is home to 500 life-size sculptures that are used to promote coral, algae, and other marine life.

Our visit Edinburgh travel guide documentary covers some of the top attractions including a food guide (best restaurants and street food), top museums and the city by day. We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities you won't find in a typical Edinburgh tourism brochure or Edinburgh, Scotland city tour.

20 Things to do in Edinburgh, Scotland Top Attractions Travel Guide Video Transcript:

Our week in Edinburgh was action packed! We sampled gin and Scotch whisky, wandered down tiny closes, braved the crowds along the Royal Mile, ate our fill of haggis, and even visited a castle, a palace, and an abbey. So, if you’re looking for things to do in Edinburgh on your visit, this video guide will show you all of those attractions and then some! 

Edinburgh Castle is hard to miss as it dominates the city’s skyline. The first thing you should know about the Castle is that it’s not just one single building, so once you’re inside there’s quite a bit to see and do; you can tour the Royal Palace, see the Crown Jewels, watch the firing of the one o’clock gun, step inside St. Margaret’s Chapel, visit the National War Museum and so much more, so give yourself plenty of time. 

We also made time to visit the famed Royal Mile, which is the busiest street in Edinburgh’s Old Town. There’s quite a bit to see along here, so we first popped into the Royal Mile Market, which is set inside a former church, and from there we continued down the street, visiting little souvenir shops along the way. You’ll have no trouble finding a kilt here!

Another activity we really enjoyed was taking a food tour with Eat Walk Edinburgh. We got to try a lot of delicious bites and beverages along the way, and one of the highlights was visiting the Fugde House. 

Another fun way to explore Edinburgh on foot is by wandering down the tiny closes. These small alleys were often named after a memorable occupant, and the Old Town is full of them. 

And that’s it for our visit to Edinburgh, Scotland. We hope you enjoyed following our travels and that this video gave you a few ideas of things to do, foods  to try, and places to visit around the city. As always, if you have any other suggestions of things to do in Edinburgh, feel free to share those with fellow travellers in the comments section below. Until next time!

This is part of our Travel in Scotland video series showcasing Scottish food, Scottish culture and Scottish cuisine.

DISCLAIMER: Brands mentioned are based on my own personal taste.

Back in May of 2019, I had the pleasure of exploring the coastal city of Busan, South Korea. These are the top 10 things you must see and do in Busan! 

1. GAMCHEON CULTURE VILLAGE: An artsy, colorful, and labyrinth-like historical neighborhood that’s offers breathtaking ocean and mountain views, as well as unusual street food. Try the bungeoppang and the orange gelatin balls with powdered peanuts!

2. HAEUNDAE BEACH: The longest beach in South Korea and one of the country’s most popular beaches. Throughout the year, it hosts events such as the Polar Bear Club and part of the Busan International Film Festival. It’s also a great place to sunbathe, swim, and enjoy water sports. 

3. JAGALCHI MARKET: Korea’s largest seafood market, which contains multiple levels that include seafood vendors, restaurants, and dining halls. Buy a fish from a vendor on the sprawling lower level and have them send it up to the cooks on the third level to enjoy an incredible chobap feast!

4. BIFF SQUARE: A large square across from Jagalchi Market that hosts part of the Busan International Film Festival. It’s home to many street food vendors who offer everything from sweet to savory to exotic foods. Try the eomuk, sundae, mandu, dakgangjeong, garibi, roasted stuffed marshmallow, and waffle ball!

5. BUSAN TOWER: A 120-meter-tall tower in Yongdusan Park that offers the best views of Busan. The circular observation deck at the top allows you to see Busan’s neighborhoods and attractions from countless angles. You can also visit the gift shops and galleries on the lower levels. 

6. TAEJONGDAE RESORT PARK: A beautiful, natural area in a thick, evergreen forest on the island of Yeongdo, just off the coast of downtown Busan. Visit the Taejongdae Clam Tents for a unique and squirmy seafood lunch, and then explore the park to see Buddhist temples, seaside lighthouses, gorgeous cliffs, and distant islands in the ocean.

7. SHINSEGAE CENTUM CITY: The largest shopping complex in the world, which boasts nine levels and countless stores, kiosks, and restaurants. You’ll find everything from cosmetics shops to casual apparel stores to luxury boutiques inside. There are even an arcade and an ice-skating rink!

8. SAJIK BASEBALL STADIUM: The best place in Busan to enjoy South Korea’s favorite pastime, baseball! The atmosphere in the stands as fans cheer on the Lotte Giants is electric! Complete the experience by getting a jersey or a hat, having a cold beer, and enjoying some tteokbokki and eomuk from the concession stand!

9. YONGDUSAN PARK: A 69,000-square-meter park that is home to Busan Tower, the Museum of World Folk Instruments, and the Exhibition Hall of World Model Boats. There are also wonderful outdoor spaces with lots of trees! 

10. BEOMEOSA TEMPLE: Busan’s most famous Buddhist temple. For full immersion, book an overnight stay to learn about Korean Buddhist culture from the resident monks, take part in prostrations and meditation, and enjoy delicious monastic meals. 

BONUS – DAY TRIP TO DAEGU: Roughly an hour northwest of Busan is the city of Daegu, which is off the beaten path for most tourists. I recommend visiting Kim Kwang-seok Street and trying the galbi jjim at Bongusan jjimgalbi!

And those are the top 10 things you must do in Busan, South Korea!

Paris is one of the most magical cities in the world! But man, it can be tough figuring out where to eat and drink like a local. It’s a city that is so popular with tourists - and that means there is an overwhelming choice of places and a fair few tourist traps to avoid!

So to celebrate our fantastic Ultimate Paris Food Tour I teamed up with our local Devour Paris expert Jess Timmins to take you to 11 places where to you can try some of the must-try tastes in this incredible city.

We focused our food tour in Le Marais district, which is a gorgeous historic part of Paris with lots of family-run business and beautiful winding streets, some of which are as they were centuries ago.

In this video we hit 11 establishments, lots of them family-run businesses. And many of them actual places we visit on our food tour.

So where did we go to eat the best food in Le Marais... and what did we try?

1. Caractère de Cochon - Paris’ best jambon-buerre sandwhich
2. Jean-Paul Hévin - Paris' best macarons and chocolate
3. Tout Autour du Pain - mind-blowing croissant and pain au chocolate
4. Grand Cafe Tortoni - gorgeous coffee shop!
5. Poilâne - famous bakery and French bread how it used to be made
6. Chez Alain Miam Miam - an incredible galette au beurre salé
7. Au Petit Fer a Cheval - pastis for a little aperitif
8. A La Villa de Rodez - a selection of delicious French cheeses and cured meats (saucission)
9. Les Philosophes - lovely bistro for excellent steak tartare and French onion soup
10. L’as du Fellafel - Paris’ best falafel, in the Jewish Quarter
11. L’Etiquette - a fabulous little wine shop (where you can also drink wine by the glass)

This is the absolute secret paradise of Saudi Arabia that the world does not know about it haha ​​!!

In my opinion it is one of the best places you can not miss if you ever travel to Saudi Arabia!!

All my colleagues and friends and I decided to use our day off a more productive way!!
We headed to the Red Sea where we rented a boat and had one of the best boat trips of our lives!! 

Crystal clear waters, coral reefs, sea turtles and even wild free dolphins!!!

 Everything reminded me of a classic boat trip in the Caribbean but it was in the Middle East!!

And guess what?? Because there is not so much tourism yet, we had the opportunity to experience the pure beauty of mother nature that this country has to offer!!

So far, Saudi Arabia is constantly surprising me with more and more things !!

Stay tuned and more videos will come from The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia!!

Ladakh 
Ladakh ""land of high passes"" is a region in Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir that currently extends from the Kunlun mountain range to the main Great Himalayas to the south, inhabited by people of Indo-Aryan and Tibetan descent.

Ladakh, open to tourism only since 1974, is a land of high passes, bounded by the Karakoram and the mighty Himalayas. The Indus with its tributaries acts is the lifeline for Ladakh's scanty population.

Ladakh covers an area of 97,000 sq kms, and has an average elevation of 3,500 m. It is often called 'Little Tibet', because of its topographical and cultural similarities with neighbouring Tibet. In the early days, Ladakh played an important role being strategically placed at the crossroads of important trade routes to Central Asia. This now remains in the past, with China having sealed off the borders of Tibet and Central Asia. 
The rugged, arid Ladakh mountain-scape has been the subject of many a photographer and destination of world-class mountaineers. Its brackish lakes at high altitudes, picturesque peaks, charming mountain villages, expansive meadows, wildlife, monasteries, rich heritage, awesome physical features, and remoteness sets it apart from other favourite holiday hot-spot.

Ladakh provides great opportunities for adventure sports such as river rafting, trekking, mountaineering and mountain biking. Adventure tourism has contributed in a big way to Ladakh's economy.

Ladakhis are sweet natured, hard working and fun loving people marking every occasion with festivities. There are a number of Monastic festivals held through out the year, whose dates are decided according to the Tibetan calendar. During summer, most villages hold colourful archery festivals and contests, while most of the religious and scio-cultural events are held during the winter.

The Ladakhis are largely dependent on cattle. They comprise a predominantly Buddhist population with the only exceptions of Kargil and the Suru Valley which is inhabited by Shia Muslims and share cultural similarities with Baltistan, now in Pakistan.

The main languages spoken are Ladakhi, Purik, Tibetan and English.

Being in the rain shadow of the Himalayas, it is generally dry, with hot and dry temperatures during summers, and cold and dry during winters. 
Its winter season is long with temperatures dropping to minus zero, and summer, warm with cool nights. Temperatures of -60 have been recorded in Drass.

Sa Pa is a small, mountain town in Lao Cai Province. It is one of the best places to visit in Vietnam. It is located about 350km northwest of Hanoi, close to the Chinese border. Home to different ethnic tribal groups, Sa Pa is very well known for its rice patties and mountain treks. My friend and I spent 3 days at Topas Ecolodge. It was such an unique experience that I had to share this.

I am Grace on Tour and travel has been my biggest passion ever since I can remember. My very first international trip was done two weeks after I was born. In the summer of 2018 I started posting on this channel as I set off on a trip around Asia before studying a semester in Taiwan. During this time my love for travel grew and I tried to travel to new places during my weekends off from university. Throughout uni I made travel a priority and worked multiple side jobs to fund my travels. After doing my thesis in Hong Kong I graduated in June 2019. At this point I decided to take a gap year and go traveling. My goal was to visit as many countries as possible. I soon realized that travel is what I love and wan´t to keep on doing. I now dream of visiting every country in the world.

These tips are from the perspective of a photographer, but the places are perfectly fine to visit if you’re a regular traveller as well.
 
I’ve been fortunate enough to travel around in Norway almost contently for the past few years as a time-lapse photographer. That has given me extensive knowledge of what Norway has to offer, also outside the most touristic places. This list includes some true hidden gems you might not have heard of before. 

Norway is a fantastic country, and this list could’ve been much, much longer. But these are my favorites, and I’m sure you’ll love them too. 

The full list: 
1. Senja
1. Varangerhalvøya
1. Femundsmarka
4. Loenvatnet
5. Valdres
6. Hardanger
7. Helgeland
8. Lofoten

246,QE19GKCwIw0,World Wild Hearts,"CRETE, GREECE (2021) | 7 Things You Can't Miss In Crete!","In this video, we highlight 7 things you can't miss in Crete Greece in 2021. Crete is the largest island of Greece and has many things to do and see. These are the 7 best things to do in Crete:

7. The 7th best thing to do in Crete is visit Heraklion. This is the largest city on the island and is also the capital of Crete, so it’s the perfect place to start your journey. Heraklion has a long history and has Arab as well as Venetian influences. It’s a great destination for anyone who loves a combination of history, beaches, and food.

6. The 6th best thing to do in Crete is to spend time at Elafonisi Beach. This pristine beach is located on the west coast of the island, about 72 km south-west of Chania. The clear, turquoise waters have brought travellers here for centuries and it was very busy when we were there as well. Not only does the lagoon have crystal blue waters with excellent visibility, but Elafonisi also has very gentle waves and is the perfect place to swim and relax.

5. Heraklion has attracted ever-greater attention as a wine destination in recent years and more than two-thirds of Crete’s vineyards are found here. The region accounts for about 80% of the island’s wine production. We went wine tasting in the nearby town of Dafnes, and highly recommend it. Not only is the setting extremely beautiful, but the wine tastings are also affordable and delicious. 

4. The 4th thing you can’t miss in Crete, Greece is Matala beach. This beach is located 68km to the southwest of Heraklion, which is about an hour drive. It’s one of the most popular tourist destinations of Crete and is a true hippie town with some incredible cave and rock formations.

3. At number 3, we have the Knossos ruins, which are widely considered to be Europe’s oldest city. The Palace of Knossos is located just south of modern-day Heraklion, near the north coast of Crete. Built by the old civilization called the Minoans, it covers about 150,000 square feet or 14,000 square meters.

☑️ Book Guided Tour of Knossos

2. Chania was by far our favorite city in Crete. On one hand, it’s beautiful and different from the other cities in Crete, and on the other hand it’s a great base to explore the island’s highlights from. The city itself is located on the northwest coast and known for its 14th-century Venetian harbor, narrow streets and waterfront restaurants.

1. Balos beach is the number one thing to do on Crete in our opinion. The panoramic views from above are some of the best we’ve seen throughout our travels so far. Balos is located in a wild, remote area about 1 hour to the west of Chania. It’s so spectacular that you may want to spend a full day here.

☑️ Book Boat Tour to Balos from Kissamos Port

250,TRGAzB858F8,TourRadar,Travelling in Italy: Best Places to Visit,"If travelling in Italy isn’t on your bucket list, why isn’t it? Italy is home to incredible food and drink, awe-inspiring history, and perfect romance. Italy comes highly-hyped, but for good reason: travelling in this Mediterranean paradise is a dream come true. If you’re preparing for a trip to Bella Italia, let TourRadar be your guide to all things Italian. 

Is any trip to Italy complete without a visit to Rome? This ancient city welcomes more than 4 million travellers each year, and for good reason: its art, culture, and food have attracted some of the greatest minds in history. Take in the Colosseum, Roman Forum, Trevi Fountain, and the Pantheon -- to name a few! The sights in Rome are never-ending.

Italy is one of the most religiously-significant countries in the world. Join us as we explore Vatican City: gawk at St. Peter’s Basilica, Pieta, the Altar of St Jerome, and the iconic painted ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, one of Michelangelo’s greatest masterpieces. Travelling Italy means never lacking for incredible views.

Speaking of views, what about something for those looking to kick back and relax? Italy isn’t all urban exploration, of course. Thankfully, we’re more than happy to cover Italy’s incredible coast. Check out the Sorrento Peninsula -- tour a mozzarella farm, or just marvel at the beach views. Take a dip in the sea, or travel further inland for amazing views paired with even more amazing wine. 

It’s almost impossible to describe all that Italy has to offer in just one video, but we’ve sure tried! Of course, if you feel like you haven’t been able to see it all, there’s only one solution: start planning an Italian adventure of your own, and get ready to spend some time travelling in Italy.

253,dUGLTmbuSzg,World Wild Hearts,"ANTALYA, TURKEY (2021) | 10 Best Things to Do in & around Antalya!","Antalya is one of the most interesting cities in Turkey! In this video, we highlight the 10 best things to do in Antalya. We hope that this information will help you plan your own trip to Antalya.

The 10 best things to do in Antalya, Turkey include:

10. The Upper Düden Falls. These waterfalls are an oasis of peace and nature located in the bustling city of Antalya. 

9. The Tünek Tepe hike. The trail is located right on the outskirts of the city and is about 7km out-and-back. The top of the trail offers a birds-eye view of Antalya as well as the beautiful blue waters and mountains around.

Recommended hiking poles: https://amzn.to/3jL6liH
 
8. The Lower Düden Falls. These waterfalls are in a different location than the Upper Düden Falls, but both are part of the same underground river. The water drops about 40m into the sea, creating an impressive sight. 

7. The 7th best thing to do in Antalya is to watch the sunset. With its year-round good weather, Antalya is the perfect place to see the sun go down. Our favorite spots are the Old Town Harbour and Atatürk Park. 

6. The ancient city of Aspendos, which is one of the best-preserved Roman theatre in the Mediterranean. There is an impressive old theatre, which is still in use today. You’ll also find ancient ruins of the city, such as an arena, basilica, aqueducts, temples and streets. 

5. The Kursunlu waterfall ranks number 5 in Antalya because of its unique color and lush nature around it. It is located about 22km to the north of Antalya, but it feels much further from the city. The area consists of waterfalls connecting 7 ponds and a backdrop of lush pine trees. 

4. The fourth best thing to do in Antalya is to visit the ancient city of Perge. Here, you can see the remains of the city, such as the column lined streets, the necropolis, Roman baths, and Greek and Roman gates. 

3. Konyaalti Beach. It's one of the two main beaches of Antalya and located on the western side of the city. The beach itself is made of pebbles instead of sand, with a beach park and numerous bars, cafes, and hotels right beside it. Konyaalti Beach is the perfect place to cool off on a hot summer day. 

2. The Old Town (Kaleici). This is Antalya’s most picturesque place. You’ll find narrow cobblestone streets, traditional houses, and a charming harbour. But besides that, it’s also the historic heart of Antalya. The best way to learn about the history of the Old Town and other things to do is to join a free walking tour.

10 Things to do in Granada, Spain Travel Guide Video Transcript: 

Wrapping up our travels in Spain, our last city to visit was Granada. Set in Andalusia at the foot of the snow capped Sierra Nevada, this is a place where Moorish influence is palpable. From hilltop fortresses to Moroccan markets, and tranquil gardens to quaint teahouses, in this travel guide we’re going to show you some of the things you can do in Granada:

This Cathedral was as grand as you’d expect. The stark white interiors were a bit of a contrast to the ornate churches we had seen in other cities, but that just made your eyes travel towards a glowing, golden altar.

The Moroccan souk turned out to be one of our favourite spots in the city. The street was packed with tiny shops standing shoulder to shoulder, all filled with leather handbags, glass lamps, wool slippers, colourful scarves and pashminas and souvenirs. 

We continued our way up the hill into Albayzín. This is one of the oldest centres of Muslim culture in Granada. The neighbourhood is a maze of narrow cobbled streets, white-houses with tiled roofs, and small courtyards sprinkled in between. 

We made time to stop at one of the teterías, or teahouses. This was the perfect place to rest on a cold winter day and enjoy some afternoon treats.

You can find numerous Moroccan restaurants in this part of the city for food. One place we ate at on more than once occasion was Al-Faguara. They offered set menus for lunch featuring hummus, falafel, couscous, tajine, and of course, lots of baklava. 

Let’s take a moment to talk about Granada’s main tourist attraction: the Alhambra!

The Alhambra is a massive complex of palaces, gardens and fortresses that once formed the citadel of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada, which was the last Muslim dynasty to rule along the Iberian Peninsula from the years 1230 to 1492.

This is the one attraction you can’t miss when you visit Granada, and you’ll want to book your tickets well in advance as they can sell out during high season.

We spent half a day touring the grounds during which time we visited the Nasrid Palaces, the Palace of Charles the Fifth, the Alcazaba, and the Generalife.

We decided to find a cafe where we could indulge in a delicious Spanish breakfast. 

Another spot we explored in Granada is Carrerra del Darro, a small lane that runs along the Darro River at the base of the Alhambra. This street is lined with arched-stone bridges and historic buildings. 

We’ll leave you with a few scenes of Granada at night and one last glimpse of the Alhambra lit up against the evening sky. 

We hope you enjoyed this video and that you got ideas of things do in Granada on your own visit. 

This is part of our Travel in Spain video series showcasing Spanish food, Spanish culture and Spanish cuisine.

The best time to Visit Phulbani is in between November to February end. 

Pakadajhar waterfall is located at Khajuripada block in Kandhamal. And one of the famous waterfalls in the Kandhamal district. This is a beautiful picnic spot in Kandhamal dist.

Locals demanded the administration renovate the site and provide it with a #tourist tag. 

Similarly, there are many beautiful waterfalls in Phulbani that are waiting to be identified and renovated for public use. One of them is the Kurmungia waterfall.

You can do a picnic there. But you should come back to Phulbani Town before sunset because there is no light facility on some of the spots.

Here I list out reasons why a typical traveler should never miss exploring this majestic #touristplace 🥰
A Citadel of Temples, Mukulingia Hill, Mandasaru Valley, #Phulbaninaturecamp, #Putudiwaterfall, #Urmagarhwaterfall, #Pakadajharwaterfall, #Kurmungiawaterfall #touristplace #waterfall 

There are some other tourist place in kandhamal district like Daringbadi hill station, Mukulingia Hill, Urmagarh Waterfall, Putudi Waterfall, Phulbani Nature Retreat, etc.

302,VMX4g19xK-M,Hiraeth,Top places in Gokarna | Things to do | Best place to visit in Gokarna ll 2 Days Itinerary | Cafes,"Goa or Gokarna?This is what your perfect weekend trip could look like! Gokarna in monsoon? part(1/2)

Gokarna is breathtakingly beautiful; it's a known fact. But how is Gokarna during the monsoon season? Even more beautiful sure, but is it safe? That's a question articles have raised often. They'll even tell you not to go because not too many cafes are open, not too many hotels are open, not too many people are there, et cetra et cetra. Here's the thing: you never need too many, you just need the right amount - 1 Namaste Cafe offering delicious food, 1 hostel, a few gorgeous beaches, and a bunch of great people to travel with. We set out for Gokarna from Bangalore and it turned out to be a great weekend trip. If you are looking for places to go to during the weekends from Bangalore, don't rule out Gokarna just because of the distance because when you reach, every kilometre will be worth it. Here's how our Gokarna itinerary, if you could call it that, looked like:

- We set out from Bangalore around 1600 on Friday
- We reached Gokarna around 0630 on Saturday
- We had breakfast and began our hike across the Om Beach, Half Moon Beach, Paradise Beach and back
- The hike was for around 8 hours
- We had breakfast and set out to look for a place to pitch our tents
- We were dead tired so we decided to look for a hotel/hostel instead
- It was monsoon and finding a place to stay wasn't exactly easy
- Kundle beach saved us, however. 
- Around late evening, we found a hostel on Kundle Beach (Rs 400 per person)
- After a solid 36 hours, we dragged our bodies to bed
- On Sunday, we had breakfast at the hostel, clicked pictures on Kundle Beach and set out for Bangalore around 1600
- We reached Bangalore around 0230 on Monday

This is just one half of the journey. The hike will be on the second part of the video and believe me, you wouldn't wanna miss it! You'll find out what hiking in Gokarna during the monsoon can really turn out to be!! Have you been to Gokarna during the monsoons before? If yes, why monsoon and how was it? If no, are you planning to? Let us know in the comments. 

Don't forget to Like and Share this video with your travel buddies!
Also, don't leave without Subscribing to Hiraeth and turning on the bell notification!!!
We love you.

When ready, browse vacation packages to Dublin: https://www.expedia.com/Dublin.d178256.Destination-Travel-Guides

Despite a long and sometimes tragic history of invasion and resistance, this thriving business capital has poetry, music and literature percolating through its cobblestones.

While #Dublin proudly honours its past, it is equally passionate about enjoying each and every new day. Nowhere is life celebrated more than in the city’s nearly 700 pubs. 

Of all the gifts, Dublin has given to the world, perhaps the most intoxicating are its stories. Originally built for the sons of the Irish gentry, the ivy-covered stone buildings of Trinity College are home to some of the oldest remaining manuscripts in the world, including the 1000-year-old Book of Kells.

Dubliner Jonathan Swift, once said, “May you live all the days of your life.” There is no better way to define Dublin. Its passion for life is contagious, captivating and sure to stay with you after your #vacation here for the rest of your days.

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

312,DgVX1dY5lCw,Must Do Travels,"Top 10 Things to Do in Krabi, Thailand 4k","Hey Must Do Travellers. Welcome back to another episode as we travel the world together. Today we’re on the southwest coast of Thailand in Krabi. Characterized by amazing beaches and rock climbing spots, this is definitely one of the must see parts of Thailand. Lets go explore! 

10. Phra Nang Beach 2:03
Phra Nang Beach is the southern strip of sand in Railay Bay. You can get to the beach by a 20-minute long-tail boat trip directly from Ao Nang or a 10 minute walk from Railay East. With super soft sand, clear shallow water, coral reef, and caves, this really is the perfect beach.

9. AO Nang 2:22
Ao Nang is a resort town. It's known for the long  beachfront and access to dive sites off the nearby islands. It has the relaxed atmosphere of a small town but the beauty of a beach resort. 

8. Khao Kanab Nam 2:43
The pair of 100-metre-high limestone rocks rise from either side of the Krabi river to form a key part of the natural scenery. Any visitor of Krabi town will get a glimpse of the rocks and their iconic tilted shapes from afar, but a boat trip to explore the cave is worth every penny.

7. Phi Phi Islands 3:02
Phi Phi Island is Thailand's superstar. It's been in the movies, tv shows and is definitely on all your friends’ must-do list. Even with all the hype, it does not disappoint. Phi Phi's beauty cannot even be captured in photos - it’s something you must experience for yourself.

6. Klong Thom Hot Spring 3:22
The Krabi Hot Springs are natural ‘hot tubs’ in volcanic chambers. If you’re into doing something extremely relaxing and therapeutic on your trip to Thailand, this is a must-do for you.

5. Krabi Shell Cemetery 3:44
Local folklore claims it’s even older than 75 million years. This is great place to visit if you’re interested in geology or historical artefacts since it is claimed to be one of only three such shell cemetery sites in the entire world. 

4.  Krabi Town 4:03
Krabi Town is a market town that was around long before international tourists started to visit the area. It's charming, laid back, and is where you can live like a local. For those interested in a dose of genuine Thai culture and hospitality, sticking around Krabi Town is a rewarding experience.

3. Wat Tham Sua 4:22
This is one of Thailand’s finest natural wonders. The temple here has beautiful icons in the main temple cave, but the real attraction here is the ‘footprint of the Buddha’. To get to this historic site you need to hike over 1000 steps up the limestone tower - but the destination is worth the journey!

2. Thung Teao Forest National Park 4:43
 This nature trek is a great place to spot rare animals and plants that are close to extinction. The forest is filled with age-old trees stretching up to the sky, unusual forest creatures and limestone foothills that open onto a dazzling emerald pool. 

Railay Beaches and Caves 5:02
Railay is an attraction in itself. It is a small peninsula accessible only by boat because of the tall limestone cliffs casting it away from the Krabi mainland. Railay is the kind of destination to get away from it all and to enjoy all that Thailand’s nature has to offer.

When ready, browse vacation packages to New York City: https://www.expedia.com/New-York.dx178293


#NewYorkCity is an international metropolis built on the shoulders of immigrants and their descendants.

The city is home to eight million people, and receives more than 50 million visitors per year. Your New York City #vacation should include sampling the food of hundreds of different cultures. You can easily #explore on foot, by taxi, or via the famous subway system.

No New York #sightseeing is complete without a visit to Times Square, which you’ve no doubt seen in many movies. Take in its billboards, its many people, and its food, then cross over to Central Park, which comprises 850 acres of lakes and meadows, and is the setting for many a romantic comedy. 

You also have your pick of art and history museums, as well as the Reflecting Absence Memorial and Museum, where you can pay your respects to the victims of 9/11.


For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Part 2- https://youtu.be/NCzejI3nzC4 
Part 3- https://youtu.be/mNy7Lfm0T9c
Do check these out.

We visited this beautiful place near Kufri in Himachal Pradesh and experienced our first snowfall. The name of the resort is The Koti Village Resort. We had an amazing experience staying there and witnessing our first snowfall. In this part of the vlog, I have covered Day 4 of our trip. It was our second day at this resort and we were even more excited to enjoy the snow. But we were struggling to keep our clothes dry, still nothing could stop us from running and jumping in the snow. Surprisingly, the Sun decided to show up in the morning and it made everything look even more beautiful. I hope you enjoy watching the video.

10 Things to do in Porto, Portugal Travel Guide Video Transcript: (OPORTO)

Lisbon is beautiful, but Porto is magical. We arrived in Porto with our taxi driver’s words still ringing in our ears, and we’re happy to say, the city did not disappoint! 

Our time in Porto was spent sipping on Port wine, soaking in the views across the Douro River, wandering through the hilly streets, and marvelling at buildings covered in blue tiles. 

In this travel guide, we’re going to share a little bit of Porto’s magic with you, and also show you some of the things you too can see, eat, and drink when you visit Porto!

Known as the Chapel of Souls, this church is covered in tiles that represent moments in the life of Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Catherine.

This bookstore is a feast for the eyes. The bookstore was even frequented by JK Rowling when she taught English in Porto, and it’s reported to have been an inspiration in her Harry Potter series.

We continued our walk downhill until we reached the São Bento Train Station. 

Porto Cathedral is one of the oldest landmarks in the city with cloisters where the walls are covered in blue tiles. 

We reached the neighbourhood of Ribeira, which sits right on the shores of the Douro River. This neighbourhood is lined with many sidewalk cafes, bars, and restaurants, so it’s a nice place to rest your legs and do a bit of people watching. Feeling hungry we wandered down some of the back streets until we found a small restaurant serving up local specialities. 

We made time for one more attraction: the Church of Saint Francis. 

The Bridge we had all been waiting for was Dom Luis the first Bridge, which spans the Douro River. The lower deck carries regular traffic with narrow walkways for those on foot, and the upper deck is reserved for pedestrians and the metro lines. 

For the best views of Porto, you need to walk the upper deck!

There was only one thing on our minds: visit one of the many wineries that line this side of the river! We ended up walking into Croft for a wine tasting without need for an appointment, and this turned out to be one of our favourite activities in Porto!

Filled to the brim with port wine, cheese and chocolate, we enjoyed a light stroll along the Douro River, watching the boats bob in the water.

That’s a wrap for our visit to Porto! We hope you guys enjoyed following along and that you got a few ideas for your own trip. If you have any other suggestions of fun things to do in and around Porto, feel free to share those with travellers in the comments below.

This is part of our Travel in Portugal video series showcasing Portuguese food, Portuguese culture and Portuguese cuisine.

338,RRcC-gcoYcQ,Djemo Graphic,Top 10 Winter Switzerland - Christmas and more! [Travel Guide],"Winter in Switzerland is a great season, as there are plenty of great things to do! Especially up in the Swiss Alps, there will be a lot of snow. There will be no greens during Winter and thus, the activities during the white season will very much differ from Summer. Winter is the season for skiing, Christmas, sledding, carnival and snow in general. Having travelled across the country during this season, I present you the Top 10 attractions of Switzerland during Winter.
Up in the Swiss Alps, there are many beautiful villages that appear specially nice during Winter. For example Grimentz is very much worth to visit during this time. Just nearby, there is the Zinal Glacier that looks very fascinating with its natural ice cave. You will need to go for a two hours’ winter hike to reach the glacier. December marks the beginning of Winter and also of Christmas season. Visit the many Christmas markets all around the country, in the larger cities or in the villages. During this month, many towns transform into charming Winter wonderland. Sledding is another great and fun activity to go for during Winter. Great toboggan runs (tracks) are up in Andermatt at the Nätschen or at Bergün. Feel the thrill of the speed while going downhill. Great views you can get at the Grindelwald First, you will see the many peaks of the Swiss Alps and also can go for skiing. Very enjoyable is the cliff walk at the Grindelwald First that takes you around a massive rock. Also consider visiting the village of Grindelwald itself. Zermatt is a very highlight of Winter up in the Swiss Alps. During this season, you will often get unobstructed views to the Matterhorn, the landmark of Switzerland. There are various places from where you can get a brilliant view over the Matterhorn: At Zermatt village itself, Sunegga, Blauherd, the Rothorn or the Gornergrat. All in all, so many great things to do during Winter in Switzerland.

341,AHkxZ0C4XJs,World Wild Hearts,"PORTO, PORTUGAL (2022) | 10 Incredible Things To Do In & Around Porto","Porto is located in northwest Portugal along the Douro River and a must-visit travel destination. From its stunning old town to its authentic cuisine and romantic viewpoints, Porto has so much to offer. These are the best things to do in and around Porto: 

10. Visit at least one of the many churches 
The most beautiful ones include: Igreja dos Clérigos, São Francisco Church, Igreja do Carmo, and the Porto Cathedral (Sé do Porto)

9. Admire the architecture at the Livraria Lello
The building dates back to 1906 and is often nicknamed the “most beautiful bookshop in the world” due to its blend of different architectural designs. 

☑️ Book your skip the line ticket in advance: https://worldwildhearts.hopp.to/porto-livraria-lello

8. Try the local food
Worth trying: tripas, bacalhau à brás, sardinhas, and francesinha

7. Walk the riverfront (Cais da Ribeira)
This is one of the liveliest parts of Porto, and a great place to walk, dine, and sightsee. 

6. Go on a cruise of the 6 bridges
From the water, you can admire the beautiful landscapes and red-roofed buildings of Porto as well as Vila Nova de Gaia. All while learning about the historic bridges that connect both cities. Boat tours leave from the riverfront in Porto (Ribeira Quay) and last about 50 minutes. 

☑️ Book your 6 bridges cruise: https://www.getyourguide.com/porto-l151/douro-river-six-bridges-cruise-t64873/?partner_id=57UJ5GF&utm_medium=online_publisher&placement=content-middle&cmp=Porto_video

5. Take in a view of the city
Best viewpoints: Miradouro da Vitória, the street next to the Porto cathedral, Passeio das Virtudes, Miradouro da Ribeira (for sunset), and from the waterfront of Vila Nova de Gaia. 

4. Day trip to Peneda-Gerês National Park
Located near the Spanish border, the Peneda-Gerês national park is a 2 hour drive from Porto. It’s the oldest protected area and the only national park in Portugal, covering about 695 square kilometers.

☑️ Book a 4x4 day tour: https://www.getyourguide.com/porto-l151/from-porto-geres-park-tour-adventure-with-lunch-t47543/?partner_id=57UJ5GF&utm_medium=online_publisher&placement=content-middle&cmp=Porto_video

3. Day trip to the Douro wine valley
The Douro wine valley is where the famous port wine is produced and it’s known as the first demarcated wine region in the world. But besides its wines, this valley is also worth visiting for its incredible landscapes, nature, and history. We spent two days in Peso da Régua and enjoyed wine tasting, hiking, and learning all about the region. 

☑️ Day cruise to the Douro wine valley: https://www.getyourguide.com/porto-l151/around-the-douro-valley-all-included-t73660/?partner_id=57UJ5GF&utm_medium=online_publisher&placement=content-middle&cmp=Porto_video

2. Visit the wine cellars at Vila Nova de Gaia
While less idyllic, Vila Nova de Gaia is also known for its port wine. In fact, all the port wine produced in the upper Douro Valley would historically be transported here in barrels on traditional boats (rabelo boats). This is why the riverbanks of Porto today are filled with wine cellars and tasting rooms. Most wine cellars offer wine tastings and guided tours.

1. Free walking tour of the city
During a 2.5 hours guided tour, you’ll see the main highlights of the city, like São Bento train station, Café Majestic, Aliados avenue, and much more. But you’ll also get some recommendations to eat, go out, and have fun. This tour leaves a few times per day from the Liberty Square (Praça da Liberdade).

368,c15saBeI9WI,Shenaz Treasury,6 Best Places To Visit In Meghalaya | Dawki |Whistling Village And More,"Today I'm taking you to Meghalaya which means ""abode of clouds""
This one has my ❤️ 
India is a land full of rivers.
1.Dawki river is actually one of the cleanest in the world. 
The water is green and crystal clear.
The river seperates India and Bangladesh.
It has a 90 year old suspension bridge where I’m standing :))
Don't you feel the boats appear to be floating on an invisible glass surface?
A boat ride is a must when you visit Dawki! 
Meghalaya is full of beautiful waterfalls. And this one for sure caught all my attention. 
2.Phi Phi falls is located in the west Jantia hills.Isn't  it gorgeous?  Which ia the most beautiful waterfall you've seen? 
Next we go to:
3. The living root bridges! These are suspension bridges made by shaping the roots of trees. Created by the people of the Khasi tribe, these roots grow from the ancient rubber trees, seen only in the northeast region. These roots are trained by the Khasis to grow in such a manner as be in the form of bridges on the top of a river.  The most popular tourist attraction of Cherrapunjee, these double decker living root bridges are 2 bridges that are stacked one on the other, made because of the entanglement of roots. Climbing down 3200 steps was worth it! 
Next is:
4. The Wei Sawdong Waterfall.The route to the bottom of the waterfalls is mostly bamboo bridges, stairs, and mud. It is extremely dangerous so be sure to wear proper trekking shoes. When wet, the bamboo is slippery so a hiking stick may help. I was super scared but the view was breathtaking. I'm in love with all the waterfalls here. 
Next I'm taking you to the most unique village ever.
5. Kongthing village also called as the ""whistling village"" here the residents have three names: a regular name, a distinct melody and a shorter tune that is akin to a nickname. Each villager here has a distinct tune as his/her name that came stright out of their mothers heart a she held them in her arms. What melody would you name your best friend as? 
Another unique gem Meghalaya hold is:
6. The "" Sacred forest""What is a sacred or holy or blessed place for you??
The people of Meghalaya hold their forests as sacred and holy. You cannot take or leave behind anything in the forest. Leave only footprints and take back only memories they say. They worship their trees and forests. What if we, like them worshipped all of nature?? Wouldn't the world be a more beautiful place?!!!

What are your view on  Meghalaya? write in the comments below and stay tuned for another beautiful place from My India!

389,nHFw-_0oALA,Cloud Cutter,Jambughoda Wildlife Sanctuary | Best place to visit near Vadodara Gujarat | Vlog | Cloud Cutter,"#jambughoda #wildlifesanctuary #gujarat #gujarattourism #nature

The sanctuary was part of the princely state of Jambughoda before Independence. A number of tribal settlements used to be wedged in the middle of the jungle then. It was established in 1989, but the status of a wildlife sanctuary was given only in May 1990.

 Located 70 km from Vadodara, and 20 km from Champaner, the Jambughoda Wildlife Sanctuary is best combined when visiting these cities. The wildlife sanctuary consists of forested hills with teeming wildlife and avian species. Teak, mahua and bamboo thickets cover the length and breadth of the forest, which is occupied by wild boars, nilgais (blue bull), jackals, hyenas, barking deer, sloth bears, and chausinghas (four-horned antelope) and leopards. A camping experience in close proximity to the wildlife is the highlight of the forest. One can book ahead at the forest rest house near the Kada reservoir. The 130.38 sq km sanctuary is a haven for nature lovers.

Following are the details about the places we visited as part of this episode.

Introduction - Kudle beach - we saw Kudle beach from distance, we were actually on way to Om beach to start our day, that is when we saw Kudle beach from height, it was an amazing view.

Om Beach - This is one of the most popular sea beach of Gokarna, name of the beach is so because it is in the shape of OM.

Sea beaches visit on Boat from Om beach - we paid Rs 4000 for this journey of one hour and fifteen minutes, where the boat man took us to Paridise beach, Half moon beach, we also saw the river and sea meeting point- confluence and also had a look at and old watch tower.

If you wish to trek and reach these points , you can do that, reaching these beaches may take upto 2 hours from gokarna.

Temple visit at Gokarna:

We visited MahaGanapathi temple and Shree Mahabaleshwar temple, both are in the heart of the city.

After the temple visit we went to have Bhojan prasad , which is served at a walking distance from Shree Mahabaleshwar temple.

Tambri parni Teertha - people visit this place for Asthi visarjan, we visited this place to pay our visit to this holy location.

Ram Teertha - This is near Gokarna beach - view of this location is really nice, its like looking at sea beach from height. Ram Teertha is the place where Lord Ram has done meditation and prayer.

Carving on rock - Walking distance from Ram Teertha
Library - This is an old library, though not maintained well.

Sanikatta - This place is famous for salt extraction from sea water.

Mangrove forest - we halted at this place for some time to have a look at the forest.

Estuary point - This is a beautiful point.

Pai restaurant -Food at this restaurant was above average, during my tour of Gokarna i learnt that as of you may not get to see good restaurants in Gokarna. 

We did our night stay at Vedic village homestay-this homestay is located at a 3 to 4 km distance from Om beach.
Tariff at this homestay is Rs 5000 for one day , 4 people can stay here , tariff includes breakfast .
Our stay at this place was quite comfortable.

397,_lcOX55Ef70,Tanya Khanijow,Solo in Paro Bhutan | Tiger's Nest visit | Bhutan Travel Guide | Bhutan Series Ep 1 | Tanya Khanijow,"Here’s presenting the first part of the Bhutan Series Episode in Paro. I went straight to Paro as first part of my road trip in the country. The drive from Phuntsholing took about 4 hours. 
 
The entire budget of my Bhutan trip was close to  INR 25k. You can carry cash everywhere in Indian currency in Bhutan as it is accepted. Some things about Paro below:

1. The place where I stayed at in Paro is called Ama’s Village Lodge. You can book the place here - https://www.booking.com/s/32_8/e9f2a7ab

2.  The cost of entry to Taktsang Goempa is INR 500 and a round trip with any driver will cost INR 1000 from your lodge

3. You can contact Mr. Yonten Norbu for driving you around Bhutan if you are visiting. His number is +975 17672515 , my experience with him was extremely nice. He was a perfect gentleman who ensured my safety and also made sure my experience in Bhutan was memorable.
 
4. If you are visiting Bhutan, I would highly advice you to get a local sim for contacting tour agencies or driver. A local sim will be available for INR 200 at Phuntsholing. 

5. Other places that you can visit in Paro are - Paro Dzong and you can get a Hot Stone bath which is very popular in the area

404,iSAW6g0mJD8,Must Do Canada,Canada Road Trip: Best Things To Do in Manitoba,"In this video, we share some of the best things to do in Manitoba, including Winnipeg and Churchill!

Welcome to Manitoba, Canada!

Right in the middle of Canada lies the province of Manitoba, which is home to the city of Winnipeg, some incredible lakes, and the polar bear and beluga whale capital of the world.

We learned about the history of human rights, did yoga with goats, learned about Canada’s history with the Hudson Bay Company, and snorkeled with beluga whales. We also relaxed in a Nordic-inspired spa, stood in the centre of Canada, and walked on the arctic tundra. We really packed a lot of adventures into our ten short days and can't wait to return one day and explore the province further.

We explored Manitoba from July 14 - July 26, 2017.

Canada's Road to 150 is a 150-day Canada-wide multi-media road trip celebrating Canada's 150th birthday by exploring the uniqueness of this country provincially and collectively while answering the question; What makes Canada special?

We will drive to and through every driveable province and territory, showcasing Canada's natural beauty and regional attractions while interviewing Canadians of all cultures and backgrounds, including local celebrities, immigrants, refugees, and everyday rural and urban Canadians. Our aim is to dig deep into what makes Canada such an incredibly inspiring country while showing off the best of Canada's tourism to Canadians and to the world.

407,biL2eVu4Ujc,Tourhub,Top 10 Places to Visit in August in India,"August is the perfect time to visit India. With the monsoon season finally over, you can now enjoy a whole new level of amazing weather. This means that you can go swimming in the ocean, go hiking in the mountains or just relax at a local beach. It’s also a great time to visit India because it tends to be much warmer than other months of the year. This means that you can spend much more time outdoors.
In addition to all of these benefits, August is also a great time to visit India because it’s one of the cheapest months of the year. Since many people are on vacation during this month, hotel prices tend to be very low. So if you want to save money while in India, August is definitely a good time to do it!

412,Ry2OuQ6RkRk,Travel Comunity,10 BEST PLACES IN VISIT BALI INDONESIA,"Bali is a province of Indonesia and the westernmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. East of Java and west of Lombok, the province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan. The provincial capital, Denpasar, is the most populous city in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the second-largest, after Makassar, in Eastern Indonesia. The upland town of Ubud in Greater Denpasar is considered Bali's cultural centre. The province is Indonesia's main tourist destination, with a significant rise in tourism since the 1980s. Tourism-related business makes up 80% of its economy.

Bali is the only Hindu-majority province in Indonesia, with 86.9% of the population adhering to Balinese Hinduism. It is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking, and music. The Indonesian International Film Festival is held every year in Bali. Other international events held in Bali include the Miss World 2013 and 2018 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. In March 2017, TripAdvisor named Bali as the world's top destination in its Traveller's Choice award, which it also earned in January 2021.

Bali is part of the Coral Triangle, the area with the highest biodiversity of marine species, especially fish and turtles. In this area alone, over 500 reef-building coral species can be found. For comparison, this is about seven times as many as in the entire Caribbean. Bali is the home of the Subak irrigation system, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is also home to a unified confederation of kingdoms composed of 10 traditional royal Balinese houses, each house ruling a specific geographic area. The confederation is the successor of the Bali Kingdom. The royal houses are not recognised by the government of Indonesia; however, they originated before Dutch colonisation.

We travel with a Microsoft Surface everywhere we go. I edit my videos on it & use it to backup my pictures and vides while we travel. It’s light and the best travel laptop on the market in my opinion. 
https://amzn.to/2L55pDR

We use Sony Alpha series cameras to film our videos. They are compact so you don’t look like a super tourist when you take great pictures and videos while you travel. 
https://amzn.to/2WbTNFH

We use Manfrotto Tripods. They are compact, travel well, and honestly I would not use another tripod for my nice cameras.

Travel Plug that works in pretty much any country & has four USB ports. A must for any traveler.

453,yONFghDe__w,World Wild Hearts,"SANTORINI, GREECE (2021) | 8 Best Things to Do in Santorini!","Santorini, Greece is one of the best islands to visit. We spent a week in Santorini and put together the best things to do in this video. We hope these tips help you on your own trip to Santorini, Greece so you can have an unforgettable experience! Here are the 8 best things to do in Santorini:

8. Visit Pyrgos.
Pyrgos is the former capital of Santorini and the best-preserved medieval settlement on the island. It is located about seven kilometers south of Fira, but feels much further away as there aren’t as many tourists in the area.

7. Red Beach
This is arguably the most famous and beautiful beach of Santorini and is located in the area of the ancient site of Akrotiri. Red Beach owes its name to the original colors of the steep cliffs created from the volcanic lava.

6. Fira is the beautiful capital of the island. It’s located on the western edge of Santorini and has a combination of natural beauty, social life, night life, and shopping.

5. Akrotiri is one of the most interesting places to visit in Greece. Being a thriving community from 4000 to 2000 B.C., this town is now covered in ash following a volcanic eruption on the island in about 1600 BC. It is also referred to as the ‘Greek Pompei’ and is extremely well preserved.

4. The 4th best thing to do in Santorini is to visit a winery. Because of its unique climate and the mineral content of its volcanic soil, Santorini produces arguably the best wine in Greece. 

☑️ Book a sunset wine tour in Santorini: https://www.getyourguide.com/santorini-l753/santorini-sunset-wine-tour-t47106/?partner_id=57UJ5GF&utm_medium=online_publisher&placement=content-top&cmp=Santorini_video

Tried to get as much of that on camera as possible, however - A huge part about travel is adapting and acclimatizing.

Hello fellow travellers! This is your solo travel guide Neha Nambiar and this time we’re exploring some gorgeous places in Uttarakhand - starting with the queen of hill stations Mussoorie! On a side note, this is the first time we’re exploring up north and just like any other Mumbaikar, I heavily underestimated the cold here.

And that’s what we did! Watch as we explore some hidden gems of Mussoorie - from the enchanting town of Landour, to the beautiful Dalai Hills and some fun street food shenanigans. 

Until Next Time, 
Neha Nambiar

And it is a tribe of such wanderers that has come together to create a community called Tripoto. 

Tripoto is one of the largest communities of travelers in the world. Travelers post breathtaking photographs, mind-blowing blogs and goosebump-inducing videos on our platforms and share them to inspire fellow travelers. 

Tripoto is essentially your one-stop shop every time you’re looking for itineraries, recommendations and any other travel-related inspiration.

486,c15saBeI9WI,Shenaz Treasury,6 Best Places To Visit In Meghalaya | Dawki |Whistling Village And More,"Today I'm taking you to Meghalaya which means ""abode of clouds""
This one has my ❤️ 
India is a land full of rivers.
1.Dawki river is actually one of the cleanest in the world. 
The water is green and crystal clear.
The river seperates India and Bangladesh.
It has a 90 year old suspension bridge where I’m standing :))
Don't you feel the boats appear to be floating on an invisible glass surface?
A boat ride is a must when you visit Dawki! 
Meghalaya is full of beautiful waterfalls. And this one for sure caught all my attention. 
2.Phi Phi falls is located in the west Jantia hills.Isn't  it gorgeous?  Which ia the most beautiful waterfall you've seen? 
Next we go to:
3. The living root bridges! These are suspension bridges made by shaping the roots of trees. Created by the people of the Khasi tribe, these roots grow from the ancient rubber trees, seen only in the northeast region. These roots are trained by the Khasis to grow in such a manner as be in the form of bridges on the top of a river.  The most popular tourist attraction of Cherrapunjee, these double decker living root bridges are 2 bridges that are stacked one on the other, made because of the entanglement of roots. Climbing down 3200 steps was worth it! 
Next is:
4. The Wei Sawdong Waterfall.The route to the bottom of the waterfalls is mostly bamboo bridges, stairs, and mud. It is extremely dangerous so be sure to wear proper trekking shoes. When wet, the bamboo is slippery so a hiking stick may help. I was super scared but the view was breathtaking. I'm in love with all the waterfalls here. 
Next I'm taking you to the most unique village ever.
5. Kongthing village also called as the ""whistling village"" here the residents have three names: a regular name, a distinct melody and a shorter tune that is akin to a nickname. Each villager here has a distinct tune as his/her name that came stright out of their mothers heart a she held them in her arms. What melody would you name your best friend as? 
Another unique gem Meghalaya hold is:
6. The "" Sacred forest""What is a sacred or holy or blessed place for you??
The people of Meghalaya hold their forests as sacred and holy. You cannot take or leave behind anything in the forest. Leave only footprints and take back only memories they say. They worship their trees and forests. What if we, like them worshipped all of nature?? Wouldn't the world be a more beautiful place?!!!

What are your view on  Meghalaya? write in the comments below and stay tuned for another beautiful place from My India!

https://www.youtube.com/user/Delhifoodwalks

Lucknow is renowned for its scrumptious and flamboyant non vegetarian food culture that includes toothsome meat delicacies extolled for their phenomenal flavours and texture. Come let's see what all non veg street food dishes did we try during our visit to the city.

First Stop- Sharma Tea Stall
A great start to the day has to be with a cup of hot tea. At Sharma Tea Stall we got our cuppas with very typical tea snacks- bun butter and samosa. The samosa you get here are quite different; the stuffing is not of the usual cubed skin-on potatoes but instead the potatoes are boiled, mashed and cooked in a concoction of unique spices. 

Second Stop- Rahim ki Nahari
Here we tried the combination of Kulcha with Nahari. The Kulcha is made of two layers which makes it the perfect vessel to eat a gravy dish like nahari. We also got taste some Biryani here. These are one of the few things that you have to try when you’re in Lucknow.

Third Stop- Tunday Kababi
We went to the first and original Tunday Kababi for the galawati kabab and sheermal. Galawati Kababs are a specialty of Lucknow. They are made with minced meat and a variety of different spices. The minced meat is shaped into small discs and cooked over a low heat from coals. The sheermal is a special bread and goes perfectly well with the spicy kababs. Sheermal is made with flour, milk, saffron, sugar and ghee; it is the slight sweetness of this bread which makes it so delicious.

Fourth Stop- Roti wali gali
We visited a street full of roti/chapati sellers. Here there are people selling different varieties of breads that are very popular in the region. Sheermal, Ulte Tawe ka Paratha, different types of Naan, etc. One can find any and everything in this little street.

Fifth Stop- Al Madina Kashmiri Chai
Here we had a different kind of dessert called kashmiri chai. It consists of Fan which is basically puff pastry also known as samosa on the area, some cream and a pink tea. It has a very soothing and warm texture.

Sixth Stop- Azhar Bhai ka Paan
Some of the most interesting names of paans and even more interesting conversation. This shop is famous for serving the tastiest paans. For them paan is not just a digestive to be eaten, it is an institution. 

Seventh Stop- Lalla ki Biryani
The ultimate Biryani experience, where the meat just melts of the bone and the rice is super flavourful. They have been making biryani for the past 34 years and no wonder, they have perfected the process. Although this shop may be known for its biryani but the shammi kababs they serve here are out of this world.

Eighth Stop- Naushijaan
Yes!! Kabab Heaven, we found kabab heaven! This place is known for their variety of kababs and trust us all of them are worth trying out. The Kakori Kabab you get are shaped like a seekh but are much softer. In fact they’re so soft that they vanish the moment you put it in the mouth. The Ghutwa Kabab was something new. It is made with minced meat that is cooked with a number of spices for very long, quite similar to the cooking process of haleem. This is usually eaten with either sheermal or khameri roti. The seekh pasanda kabab is slightly chewy compared to all the other kababs.

Ninth Stop- Sakhawat’s 
Established in 1911, known for its outstanding galawati and kakori kababs. We even got to try the biryani here, which was quite different compared to the ones we had tried earlier. Everything that we tasted was supremely tasty.

Tenth Stop- Wahid Biryani
For a change, we tried chicken biryani and weren’t disappointed at all. The biryani is flavourful and aromatic that you feel like you have actually gone back in time and are feasting with the Nawabs of Awadh.

Eleventh Stop- Prakash Kulfi Shop
The Kulfi is made in the traditional way in small steel tins in which the ingredients that are first boiled are then filled into the tins and then they are frozen in a large container full of ice. Our journey in Lucknow ended with this beautiful Kulfi.

This time we made it to Lincoln, UK and we were pleasantly surprised by the city. I now consider Lincoln to be one of England's Best Kept Secrets.  The City centre had a great vibe... 

We actually spent two weekends in Lincoln because we enjoyed to vibe in the city so much.

🥒 ABOUT BEFRS:
Hey, I’m Sonny! I’m from the US but I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer.
 
If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

Description-
Around 20 kilometres from the main city of Jaipur, there is a mock village called ‘Chokhi Dhani’, which is a perfect mirror to the Rajasthani culture, food, traditions and heritage. The name Chokhi Dhani literally translates to Rajasthani Culture.

Specially designed to attract and introduce tourists to the authentic Rajasthani culture and heritage, the village was set up in 1989 over an area spanning 10 acres. Soon after, by 1994, Chokhi Dhani gained its own share of fame among the tourists across the world.

Since it displays the vibrant culture, art, folklore and tradition of Rajasthan, visitors can experience the countryside life and learn about the history of the Rajput valour.

Location of Chokhi Dhani Jaipur-
Chokhi Dhani village is situated on the Ajmer- Jaipur highway, towards the Jaipur end. The village is located away from the hustle of the city and imparts peace and serenity to the travellers.

In today's World Cup vlog we are taking you to a few of the most famous places in Doha such as the Perl and the Corniche as well as the official Fan Zone for the World Cup. 

Exclusive behind-the-scenes content: 
https://www.patreon.com/KineticKennons

Doha, Qatar is an interesting place. It seems to be a country of contrasts. Desolate deserts and beautiful beaches are all within just a few miles of one another. The truth is that we aren't sure what to think of Qatar just yet. With so much of the development being brand new, it has in interesting feel to it. I think it is because there has yet to be a history to much of the buildings and developments that you see around the city. The skyline of New York City is impressive, but what makes it so neat is the stories behind the buildings and the neighborhoods they inhabit. That takes time to happen. The city is very visually impressive but we are yet to know what else Qatar has to offer. Luckily, we will have the opportunity to discover that for ourselves over the next two weeks. 

We are the Kinetic Kennons and over the next few weeks we will be bringing you along with all of our Qatar World Cup adventures! We will be documenting the games, the Fan Zone, the cost of living in Qatar, what it’s like to be in Qatar during the World Cup, and everything in between!
