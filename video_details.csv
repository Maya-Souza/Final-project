0,wLSyTqAzUMc,Backpacking Bananas,Copacabana & Isla Del Sol 🇧🇴 Backpacking Bolivia Travel Vlog,"My final stop in Bolivia is Copacabana! Situated still at a very high altitude (🙄lol) on Lake Titicaca. I stayed at Hostal Florencia and met Harry and Tori and together we took a boat to Isla Del Sol and hiked over 10km across the island, visiting the ruins along the way. It was a fantastic day out but challenging with the altitude!

ABOUT ME🙋🏻‍♀️
I'm Christianne, a solo traveller, vlogger and entrepeneur from Surrey, UK. I spend half my time exploring new places around the globe with my backpack, and the other half creating videos about my experiences, what I'm packing, solo travel advice, money budgeting tips and anything else in relation to my backpacking lifestyle.

FAQ's
How do you afford to travel? - I now earn a full time living through creating these YouTube videos, affiliate links, selling digital products and my clothing line. I used to simply just work any temporary job I could find to save up to travel! I budget the money I earn meticulously to reach my savings goals using https://www.backpackingbananas.com/product-page/life-budget-tracker-uk-self-assessment-version
Is travelling solo safe? - I would argue the answer is almost always yes! As long as you use your common sense and you follow your own government's guidelines about travelling in that country. I have made several videos on backpacking safety on my channel.
Do you have plans to settle down? Yes, I'm currently saving to purchase my first property in the UK and I'd love to have children one day. I doubt I'll ever live a completely 'conventional' lifestyle by society's standards though, as I often have my own preferred way of doing things.

#TravelWithWife


▶️ Who is Travel With Wife?  

We got married in 2018. Like everyone else, we earned our means through 9-5 jobs for years. Chamri was working in sales, and Kasun as a photographer. We both loved to travel. After years of working in corporate structures, we decided to start “Travel with Wife”, an idea we thought of during our first wedding anniversary trip, where we wanted to share the details of our trip with our friends and family. 
We soon fell in love with a travelers lifestyle and began our vlog, which was a turning point in our lives. We got to visit 5 countries, in addition to exploring the crevices of our beautiful island home, Sri Lanka ✈️. 

We toured until the pandemic confined us to our homes. In 2020, our travel princess Elina was born and joined our little travel family 👨‍👩‍👧. We can’t wait to start our travels again, with our new adventurer! We thank you for your consistent support and love, we can’t wait to show you everything we have planned!

When we were discussing yesterday his health issues, I feel like I needed to help. Surgery is hard to come by for leather workers, as they don't earn that much, so I know this will be a big help to him. Whether he uses this money for surgery, or to help out his family, I know this will be of great assistance to him and his future.

Despite being within easy reach of Florida and the Bahamas, #Cuba exists in a time and space all its own. 
 
Explore Cuba’s capital, Havana, a city preserved by forts, a five-mile seawall, and an imposed embargo, which held back the excesses of the 20th century for over 50 years. Havana’s lure can be hard to resist, but a #vacation in Cuba can offer so much more beyond the seductive lights of its capital. In Cuba, a long sandy beach is never far away. 
 
Sometimes it’s hard to know whether Cuba is awakening to the world, or if the world is awakening to Cuba. Whatever your politics, it's easy to admire this island nation that has proudly gone its own way. Cuba may still have one foot firmly in the past, but as the world tumbles towards tomorrow, we can be thankful for the many things it has not let go.

Two-thirds of the Fijian archipelago are uninhabited, and your Fiji #sightseeing should include a stop at Denarau’s marina, where you can book a boat to take you to some of these pristine locations. From family-friendly islands to romantic getaways, you’ll find something to your taste amongst these scattered isles.

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Sharing with you the latest data on the most delayed airlines and airports around the world. Think twice before you travel! 

Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) had the highest number of flight cancellations in Europe after its pilots went on a strike. The troubled airline has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US. Eurowings is another carrier that has cancelled about 8% of their flights last minute. 

Toronto Pearson Airport saw the most flight delays in North America, followed by Dallas Fort Worth and New York-JFK. 46% of Air Canada flights ran late. In the last 30 days, an average of one out of five flights a day arrived behind schedule in the U.S. 

I am also sharing some useful tips on how to travel these days. Fly in the morning on non-stop flights, bring only carry-on bags, download airline apps, knowing your rights and being patient are some of the key takeaways to survive delays and cancellations. 

At the end of the video, an aviation expert talked about when we will expect a smoother travel experience and how to fix the current problem.

40,k9Pvd-5F9_c,OnBoardHD,TRIP REPORT | Almost Diverted for Drunk Passengers! | Vienna to Amsterdam | Easyjet Airbus A319,"Easyjet Trip Report flying from Vienna to Amsterdam onboard one of the Easyjet Airbus A319, operqted by Easyjet Europe, on a lovely late-winter afternoon.

What a flight! It is the first time in more than 800 that I see 5 policemen entering the plane at the destination airport to takw somebody out of the plane. In this case it was not one person, but 2 groups of 3-4 people each. During all the flight they were without mask, making noise and drinking their own alcohol (which is forbidden). The crew warned them several times and they became disrispectful. Calling the police on arrival to Amsterdam was the solution. Well deserved. Well done EasyJet.

As far as the flight itself is concerned, the day was perfect for flying: not a single cloud until we reached Amsterdam, where we encountered some strong winds with some spare clouds. The route from Vienna to Amsterdam took us initially over the city of Vienna, then through the south of the Czech Republic, across Germany and finally down to Amsterdam.

The service on board Easyjet, as a low-cost airline, is completely pay-per-eat. I don't know the current offer, but at the time of this flight (April 2022) the gastronomic offer was very limited. I chose to have lunch on the plane that day, so I bought a cheese and tomato calzone, a drink and some chips. The calzone was quite good, as usual, the rest you know perfectly well.

Now it is your turn!
Have you ever flown with EasyJet? Which route? In which plane model? How was the experience? Have you ever seen a situation like this? Have you ever been in Amsterdam? Maybe in Vienna?
Lots of things to talk about! Read you in the comments!

❤️️ If you made it that far, We appreciate you. Thank you for sticking around. You are awesome.


▶️ Who is Travel With Wife?  

We got married in 2018. Like everyone else, we earned our means through 9-5 jobs for years. Chamri was working in sales, and Kasun as a photographer. We both loved to travel. After years of working in corporate structures, we decided to start “Travel with Wife”, an idea we thought of during our first wedding anniversary trip, where we wanted to share the details of our trip with our friends and family. 
We soon fell in love with a travelers lifestyle and began our vlog, which was a turning point in our lives. We got to visit 5 countries, in addition to exploring the crevices of our beautiful island home, Sri Lanka ✈️. 

We toured until the pandemic confined us to our homes. In 2020, our travel princess Elina was born and joined our little travel family 👨‍👩‍👧. We can’t wait to start our travels again, with our new adventurer! We thank you for your consistent support and love, we can’t wait to show you everything we have planned!

57,buVfghS3tKM,OnBoardHD,TRIP REPORT | The Emirates A380 Excellence! | Dubai to Madrid | Emirates Airbus A380,"Emirates Trip Report flying from Dubai to Madrid onboard one of the amazing Emirates Airbus A380 on a beautiful summer day over the Persian/Arabian Gulf and Europe.

A comfortable flight on the Emirates A380 from Dubai to Madrid. For the first time, I went on an Emirates A380 plane with no free seats next to me and I can say even this way, it's more comfortable than any other plane. What an amazing cabin!

Talking about the flight route, we took off from Dubai towards the south, and quickly after departure, we made an almost 180° turn back to Dubai.
The views of Dubai downtown were more than marvelous. They were just perfect! Finally, I had more than 30 seconds of the Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall without any turbulence! It was really amazing!

On today's flight, we took a southerly route. That means we flew over the Persian Gulf towards Bahrein, then Saudi Arabia and Jordania. We then entered the Mediterranean sea and flew directly to Creta island. From there we left Malta on our left and flew over Tunis. We entered the Peninsula over Valencia, already on direct course to Madrid, where we landed on runway 18L after a nice approach over the mountains.

About the catering service, there were 2 services. A ""continental breakfast"" (at least that's what they call an apple pastry and yogurt) and the main lunch. I went for the chicken option, with broccoli, rice, and tomato sauce. The other option was beef with mashed potatoes. That main meal included a pasta salad, some cheese and bread, and a dessert. Everything was tasty, but I had better meals onboard Emirates already. That being said, remember that Emirates in economy class is better than some others in business class.

Now it's your turn! Have you ever flown with Emirates? How was the experience? Which route did you fly? Have you been in Dubai? Maybe in Dubai? Have you ever flown on an Airbus A380? Which one do you prefer for flying with Emirates: the B777 or A380?
Lots of things to talk about! See you all in the comments!

We really got a lot of experience. Jetski, kayaking. Not only that, our favourite thing in every travel is the sunset. This time we went to see the sunset on a boat in the middle of the sea. So all these experiences are very special for us. Because all these things were experienced with our little Elina.

❤️️ If you made it that far, We appreciate you. Thank you for sticking around. You are awesome.


▶️ Who is Travel With Wife?  

We got married in 2018. Like everyone else, we earned our means through 9-5 jobs for years. Chamri was working in sales, and Kasun as a photographer. We both loved to travel. After years of working in corporate structures, we decided to start “Travel with Wife”, an idea we thought of during our first wedding anniversary trip, where we wanted to share the details of our trip with our friends and family. 
We soon fell in love with a travelers lifestyle and began our vlog, which was a turning point in our lives. We got to visit 5 countries, in addition to exploring the crevices of our beautiful island home, Sri Lanka ✈️. 

We toured until the pandemic confined us to our homes. In 2020, our travel princess Elina was born and joined our little travel family 👨‍👩‍👧. We can’t wait to start our travels again, with our new adventurer! We thank you for your consistent support and love, we can’t wait to show you everything we have planned!

Kasol is a hamlet in the Kullu district of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. It is situated in Parvati Valley, on the banks of the Parvati River, on the way between Bhuntar and Manikaran. It is located 30 km (19 mi) from Bhuntar and 36 km (22 mi) from Kullu town, the district headquarter, 3.5 km from Manikaran. Kasol is the Himalayan hotspot for backpackers and acts as a base for nearby treks to Malana and Kheerganga. It is called Mini Israel of India due to the high percentage of Israeli tourists here.
Manikaran is located in the Parvati Valley on river Parvati, northeast of Bhuntar in the Kullu District of Himachal Pradesh. It is at an altitude of 1760 m and is located 4 km ahead of Kasol and about 45 km from Kullu and about 35 km from Bhuntar.
This small town attracts tourists visiting Manali and Kullu to its hot springs and pilgrim centres. An experimental geothermal energy plant has also been set up here.

Manikaran is a pilgrimage centre for Hindus and Sikhs. The Hindus believe that Manu recreated human life in Manikaran after the flood, making it a sacred area. It has many temples and a Gurudwara.[1] There are temples of the Hindu deities Rama, Krishna, and Vishnu.[2] The area is well known for its hot springs[3] and its beautiful landscape.

According to legend, when the Hindu God Shiva and his consort Parvati were walking in the valley, Parvati dropped one of her earrings. The jewel was seized by Shesha, the serpent deity, who then disappeared into the earth with it. Shesha only surrendered the jewel when Shiva performed the cosmic dance, the Tandava and shot the jewel up through the water. Apparently, jewels continued to be thrown up in the waters at Manikaran.

Not only is Malaysia a melting pot of ethnic cultures, but it is also a blend of many different customs, cuisines and religions all coexisting peacefully together. From large island groups to mountains and tropical rainforest, the country’s geography is every bit as diverse. What’s more, Malaysia is a unique country in that is divided into two main landmasses. West Malaysia occupies the southern half of a peninsula shared with Thailand, while East Malaysia is situated on the Borneo island.

77,YMUtyA7wNXI,Expoza Travel,Ecuador Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Ecuador.
Ecuador is the smallest of the Andes’ states in South America and a land that derived its name from the Equator.  A natural paradise with a living Indian culture and captivating colonial towns that was once part of the Inca Realm and later the sought-after possession of various European colonial powers. Quito, the ""divine city"", is the capital of Ecuador.  Steep and narrow steps lead downhill to the Centro Historico in which many of its small buildings have been rebuilt several times due to devastating earthquakes.  In 1536, Quito was newly founded and built on the ruins of an Inca town. West of Quito the edge of the extinct Pululahua Volcano is accessible by car. It is the largest volcanic crater in South America and the huge caldera with its steep slopes has a diameter of four to five kilometres and is hundreds of metres deep. One and a half hours from Quito are the Termas De Papallacta, the most beautiful spa baths in Ecuador.  Hot springs were discovered here and an infrastructure built to make them accessible to tourism, an idyllic spot set in remote nature and at an altitude of around four thousand metres above sea level. The southern sierra of Ecuador is a green and fertile landscape.  The Andes is flatter here and the peaks of the volcanoes are free from snow.  This is the most important monument of Incan culture in Ecuador, the ruins of Ingapirca, a location with a long and dramatic past. Around a thousand kilometres from Ecuador, within the Pacific Ocean, is a scattered group of nineteen volcanic islands, the Galápagos Islands and even below the water there are creatures that seem to come from another world. Ecuador is truly fascinating due to its vast variety of culture and nature and its amazing mountain landscapes are the backbone of the country.  Ecuador is a unique adventure where South America is at its most beautiful!

84,uADB0pAC5Cs,OnBoardHD,TRIP REPORT | 27 hours to Santo Domingo! | KLM B787 & DELTA | Vienna to Santo Domingo (via New York),"KLM & Delta Trip Report on a mega trip from Vienna to Santo Domingo (in the Dominican Republic) via Amsterdam and New York JFK airport, flying a KLM Boeing B787-10 Dreamliner, a KLM Boeing 737-800W, and a Delta Airlines Boeing 737-900S.

A 27 hours amazing trip to cover more than 9000 km flying to the Dominican Republic (also known as paradise :) ). We finished the trip exhausted but it was more than worth it. This was my first time flying long-haul with KLM and, of course, it's the first KLM Trip Report flying a long-haul route in the channel. Also, this was the first time in my life that I was in New York and in Santo Domingo. Lots of new things for the channel in this video.

Once in New York, we had a layover of 3 hours before our connecting flight to Santo Domingo with Delta, flying this time on a Boeing 737-900S. As this was a completely night-time flight, I just included the most iconic moments of it. Also, in New York JFK, we made a very nice planespotting session, with lots of planes that we are not used to watch on the channel (but that we'll see a lot in the next months!).

Don't worry about the length of this video: this is an exception. I wanted to show in this Trip Report the experience of a 3 flights-trip in just one video. This won't be the standard length of the videos. But, as you can see, this was the minimum length to be able to show a minimum level of detail. Hope you will enjoy it!

Now it's your turn! Have you ever flown with KLM or Delta? Which route? How was the experience? In which plane? How was the catering service? Which plane do you prefer: the A350 or B787? Have you ever been to Santo Domingo? Which airline did you fly to get there?
Lots of things to talk about! Read you all in the comments!!

90,KbVPbHhAi_I,OnBoardHD,TRIP REPORT | First Time on the A350 Business Class! | IBERIA Airbus A350 | London to Madrid,"IBERIA Trip Report flying in Business Class onboard one of the Iberia Airbus A350, their absolute flagship, from London to Madrid on a perfect early-summer afternoon.

An extremely comfortable flight onboard the Iberia Business Class of the Airbus A350. I mean, it couldn't be another way. A long-haul plane, long-haul business class cabin for a 2h flight... it must be great and it was absolutely fantastic. Before boarding, we'll also watch some glimpses of the British Airways Business Lounge and a short but beautiful planespotting session.

Regarding catering, Iberia is known for offering a really good short-haul business class. This was not the exception. I went for the beef option and, together with a humus and beans salad and a delicious strawberry mouse with real strawberries, it was a perfect meal. Wine, coke, and a very nice coffee completed the meal. 

About the flight itself, we took off from runway 09R in London-Heathrow and made a quick right turn, towards Southampton and Portsmouth. From there we crossed the English Channel toward the Brest area and the Cantabrian sea. We entered Spain over Santander and, after a lovely approach over Sierra de Madrid, landed at Madrid-Barajas airport well ahead of the schedule.

Now it's your turn! Have you ever flown with IBERIA? How was the experience? Which route did you fly? Have you ever flown on the A350? Have you been in Madrid? Maybe in London? Have you ever flown on a long-haul plane in business class? What are your thoughts about it?
Lots of things to talk about! See you all in the comments!

Finally, one of the long awaited flyovers in the city, the four-lane bi-directional flyover from Shilpa Layout to the Outer Ring Road near Gachibowli Junction, is all set for inauguration.

Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials said around 95 per cent of work on the flyover, which has taken quite some time in the making, were completed and the remaining part too would be completed by November.
“Some works could not be completed due to the intense spells of rains recently. As we are expecting intense spells of rains during September, we are hoping to complete the remaining work by November,” a GHMC official said, adding that around five spans were yet to be laid besides some final touch-up works.

The Shilpa Layout flyover is 823 metres in length and 16.60 metres wide. Once open to traffic, the flyover will ensure free flow of traffic from Shilpa Layout to the ORR. On the Shilpa Layout road, peak hour traffic in 2020 was 1,464 passenger car units (PCU) per hour and the projected peak hour traffic in 2040 is 5,194 PCU per hour.

The flyover has already been termed an engineering feat by the GHMC, with some spans of the flyover being installed 18 metres above the ground and placed across the existing Gachibowli Crossroad Flyover.

In addition to this facility, simultaneously, construction of another six-lane bidirectional flyover towards Kondapur is underway. Presently, the foundations of this project are under construction and the flyover will be 816 metres long and 24 metres wide.

“The probable date of completion of this six-lane bidirectional flyover is December 2023,” a GHMC official said.

The estimated contract value of both projects is Rs.313.52 crore and both these projects are being built under the State government’s flagship Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP).

Both these flyovers have a series of benefits to offer after they are made available to the public. Traffic at the busy Gachibowli Junction will be decongested to a great extent. They will also ensure better connectivity between HITEC City and the Financial District besides easing traffic heading towards Meenakshi Group Buildings.","['shilpa layout flyover', 'shilpa layout flyover at gachibowli', 'shilpa layout flyover opening date', 'shilpa layout hmt colony', 'shilpa layout shankarpally', 'shilpa layout tellapur', 'shilpa layout orr flyover', 'shilpa layout flyover plan', 'hyderabad shilpa layout flyover', 'hyderabad shilpa layout', 'hyderabad developments', 'shilpa layout to gachibowli flyover', 'shilpa layout', 'shilpa layout gachibowli', 'flyovers in hyderabad', 'hyderabad flyover construction', 'hyderabad flyovers']",2022-11-23T10:30:03Z,15582,611,,78,PT5M17S,false

96,Wk5f-WMic9s,Expoza Travel,Scotland (Europe) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Scotland, located in the north of the United Kingdom, is a fascinating and atmospheric land. A land of Celtic myths and legends with green hills, barren highlands, mysterious lakes and mighty castles.In the centre of the capital the impressive Edinburgh Castle crowns the hard basalt cone of an extinct volcano, the historic heart of the nation. The beauty of the dense forests and hills of the Trossachs was made famous by author, Sir Walter Scott, in the nineteenth century.  It is the most scenic region in central Scotland and possesses grandiose, wild and romantic scenery. The remote Loch Katrine brings to mind Sir Walter Scott’s poem, The Lady Of The Lake. On the Firth Of Lorne is Kilmartin Glen one of the most important prehistoric regions in Scotland.  Here, standing-stone, three metre high monoliths are scattered across meadows with grazing sheep. The Bronze Age megalithic grave mounds and stone circles can be seen from Duchraigaig Cairn. Across the north runs the Great Glen with Loch Linnhe, Lochy and Ness marking its course which passes through some amazing landscapes. In Fort William Train Station, the Jacobite is awaiting its passengers. The huge black monster is an impressive sight. Slowly, the nostalgic train moves off and begins its journey on one of the most beautiful railway routes in the world. The history of Glenfarclas is as colourful as the whisky of the same name. It is the story of the Grant Family and their distillery. ‘Scottish Gold’ must be stored for at least three years until the traditional taste of single malt whisky is produced but it can often be left to mature for between twelve and fifty years. Scotland is like a land from an ancient and historic time whose real treasure is its natural, rugged scenery!

#Lima gives access to the mystical city of Machu Picchu in the Andes, Lake Titicaca in the highlands, the lush Amazon jungle and Peru’s coastal desert. But, before you go to see all of this, it’s worth exploring the capital first.

Continue your #vacation outside of the city center. The Bajada de los Baños in bohemian Barranco is home to the Bridge of Sighs. In Miraflores is Huaca Pucllana, a pre-Columbian temple of some 1,500 years old. The Museo Larco in Pueblo Libre contains amazing pre-Columbian artifacts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The island of Santorini has a pretty explosive past. It’s perched over the remains of a much larger land mass that sank almost 4,000 years ago when a volcano blew its top, leaving the blue caldera and steep cliffs behind. 

It is these cliffs and the flooded caldera that have become Santorini’s iconic calling card, and the first stop on your Santorini tour. Here’s your first bit of trivia: The whitewashed homes that appear on so many postcards and photographs are larger than they appear on the outside. They’re partially built into existing cliffside caves, and feature some of the most distinctive Mediterranean architecture you’ll ever see. 

Santorini sightseeing will no doubt bring you up the stairs and pathways to the blue-domed churches that stand guard over the island. From there, you can take in the exquisite view of the caldera and harbor below. If you get a little weary of the spectacular sights, don’t worry; there’s plenty of things to do besides wander the various clifftop towns. If you head down to water level, you can soak in the warm surf, explore Santorini’s many beaches, go for a drive along winding roads, or go on a fishing expedition from one of the harbors. 

At the end of the day, gather with the residents and visitors atop the cliff towns and watch the sun drop into the ocean. You’ll never see a view quite like it.

What part of Santorini do you want to see?

Etihad Trip Report flying from Abu Dhabi to Vienna onboard one of the Etihad Boeing 787-9 on a lovely summer morning.

A very comfortable flight from Abu Dhabi to Vienna onboard the Etihad Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Etihad early-morning wave departs towards Europe around 3-4am, which means that all passengers were sleeping during the majority of the flight, so the flight was even more comfortable with a silent cabin.

When we were around 1 hour in the air, over Kuwait, we found one of the biggest storms I've ever seen (probably the biggest one; well for sure the biggest one). It was amazing to see so many lightning strikes from such a huge cumulus of cumulonimbus clouds. It was huge, enormous. For sure the most active storm I have ever seen from a plane. It forced us to deviate our route to the right, towards Irak.

After a couple of hours cruising towards Vienna, the Sunrise started when flying over Irak. What a marvelous view! We could see how the sky was changing colors, from a very dark blue to a reañly intense orange, with many others in between. It was really beautiful to enjoy such a peaceful moment after the huge storm we circumnavigated 1h before.

About the onboard service, just after takeoff, the crew passed through the cabin offering 1 drink and 1 little bag with a small bottle of water and some kind of tomato (Marguerita) sandwich.

The main meal came over the Black Sea, already with daylight, and consisted of a nice breakfast. I decided to go for the classic option: cheese and tomato omelet with spinach, potatoes, and lamb sausage. It included a croissant with jam and yogurt. I must say it was really tasty, everything, but the portion was too little.

Our route today took us over the Persian Gulf, with a right deviation towards Irak to circumnavigate the storm, Turkey, the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and, finally, Vienna (Austria). All in all, a nice flight that I wouldn't mind repeating in the future. Etihad is an airline that with a couple more details could be competing perfectly with Emirates or Qatar Airways. Let's see how they do in the future!

Now it's your turn! 
Have you ever flown with Etihad? Which airplane? Which route? How was the experience? Do you think they are at the same level as Emirates or Qatar Airways? Have you ever been in Vienna? Maybe in Abu Dhabi? Have you ever seen a storm like this one on a plane?

I finally got a chance to fulfill my bachpan ka sapna and I couldn’t be more thankful. Whatever you have heard about the enchanting and mesmerizing aura of Kedarnath, it is true. In this video, I have given a detailed explanation on my travel and journey to Kedarnath from Dehradun’s Jolly Grant airport, my stay options & what it felt like to finally reach Kedarnath, so make sure you watch to the end. 

I took the helicopter ride to Kedarnath from the Sitapur helipad which is about 26 km ahead of Guptkashi. The fare of the five seater helicopter came to ₹7347 per person approx for a round trip. Pilgrims can also book one way ticket too. It will cost ₹3200 per person approx. Extra charges are taken for priority darshan for the same day passengers.

Well if you’re planning your visit to this temple in the upcoming months, this video can surely act as a complete guide for you!

112,RlIUeKAVn4E,OnBoardHD,TRIP REPORT | Emirates Excellence Over the Atlantic | New York to Milan | Emirates A380,"Emirates Trip Report flying from New York to Milan onboard one of the Emirates Airbus A380 on a beautiful night over the Atlantic and sunny spring day over Europe.

An extremely comfortable flight across the Atlantic from New York to Milan onboard the Emirates Airbus A380-800. I know I said it a lot of times... but it is just the reality: flying with Emirates is flying to the absolute next level.

Once again, the cabin crew was extremely kind, the food really tasty, the space on the seat was great and the cabin on the A380 is just perfect. If you take any of those alone, is great. But if mix them all together on a single flight... well, that's Emirates.

About the flight itself, after a nice planespotting session at New York Kennedy airport, we headed to the boarding gate. To my surprise, we were going to board the A380 by bus! It was something completely new for me. However, it didn't look like the best idea when we realized how it was raining outside. Later on, the captain told us that the jetways on the usual gate were not working. So bus and stairs were the only options available.

We took off from New York JFK under a very heavy rainstorm. We just could see through the window for around 30 seconds after lift-off. Then, we entered the clouds until the Sunrise. As always, I've set my alarm for the estimated time of Sunrise... and it paid off! What an amazing experience to see the sunrise over the Atlantic on an A380! After that, we flew to the south of Ireland and the United Kingdom; entered France over the Brest area; overflown Paris, including some stunning views of the Eiffel Tower; and crossed the Alps, already in descent to Milan Malpensa airport.

As said before, the Emirates catering service is top class. Every single Emirates meal looks special. For this flight, I had a chicken barbeque with mashed potatoes and vegetables. First was a chickpea salad and the dessert was a 3 chocolates delice. After the meal, I asked for another dessert and I had it on my table in less than 50 seconds! It was just amazing. 

Now it is your turn! Have you ever flown with Emirates? In which airplane model? Which route? How was your experience? What do you think about their onboard service and cabin? Is the Emirates catering the best one in the world? Had you ever boarded an A380 by bus?

A comfortable flight from Los Angeles to Frankfurt onboard the Lufthansa Boeing 747-8. The airplane was almost full, but we were lucky that the middle seat was free, so the extra space made this 11h flight a lot easier.

The onboard service, although it has nothing to do with middle-east airlines, was not bad. Definitely better than the one offered on my previous flight to Dubai with Lufthansa on the Boeing 747-400. At least this time the salad was not only lettuce... The pasta main meal was actually pretty good. Not amazing but tasty.

The flight itself was really nice: we took off from Los Angeles airport towards the Pacific Ocean and made a quick 180° over the coast back to the United States. We had some nice views before we caught the night. The ones over Las Vegas, the Nevada desert, or the Rocky Mountains were truly amazing.

The Sunrise over the Atlantic was also really nice. First, the intense blue colors, which after a short time, turned into yellow, orange, and red. That's the magical moment of any flight: 100% of the passengers are sleeping and the plane is in complete silence. The perfect atmosphere to enjoy the Sunrise at 37.000 ft. We entered Europe mainland over Brussels and flew on direct course to Frankfurt, where we landed after a beautiful approach.

Now it is your turn! Have you ever flown with Lufthansa? Which route? How was the experience? Have you ever been in Los Angeles? Maybe in Frankfurt? Which airline did you fly to get there? What do you think about the Lufthansa onboard service? Have you ever flown on a Boeing 747?

115,TUOX7yztnUg,OnBoardHD,TRIP REPORT | First Time with Emirates A380! | Dubai to Vienna | EMIRATES Airbus A380,"Emirates Trip Report flying from Dubai to Vienna onboard one of the Emirates Airbus A380 on a lovely late-autumn morning.

My very first Trip Report with Emirates and on the Emirates A380. It was more than an amazing flight. It was incredible. I've read lots of reviews and watched lots of Trip Reports about Emirates flights (in Economy) and it still surprised me. I can't explain it very well... Emirates has an aura around it that makes an extraordinary experience from ordinary things.

The flight had everything that I could want for a Trip Report video: amazing catering, lots of views of places where I've never been, a perfect engine view on the A380... I've enjoyed this flight a lot and I can't wait for the next time I will be flying with Emirates.

I would like to highlight a moment on the video as the most iconic one... but the Trip Report is full of them. However, if would be forced to just pick one moment of the video, that one would be probably the moment in which we fly over the Burj Khalifa. Flying on an Emirates A380 over the Burj Khalifa is the perfect definition of what Dubai is and what the United Arab Emirates want to be.

Have you ever flown with Emirates? Which route? In which airplane? How was the experience? Is Emirates the best airline in the world in your opinion?
Lots of things to talk about! Read you all in the comments section!

119,S0TemlxiMdw,TEDx Talks,Learn to travel -- travel to learn: Robin Esrock at TEDxVancouver,"Robin Esrock's success as a global adventurer, travel writer, TV producer and international TV personality was no accident, although it did start with one. Struck down on his bike at a Vancouver intersection, Robin hobbled away with a broken kneecap, and one year later, a modest $20,000 insurance settlement. It was just enough for him pack up his things, quit his job, and set off on a one-year solo round-the-world backpacking adventure to 24 countries. He named his journey Modern Gonzo, and committed to record his year of living dangerously, with online weekly reports, photography, videos, and interviews with every person he met. In doing so, he pioneered a new era of multi-platform, switched-on and wired-in travel journalism, leading to adventures beyond his wildest dreams.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)","['Travel', 'TEDxVancouver', 'tedx talks', 'Canada', 'ted x', 'tedx', 'ted talk', 'tedx talk', 'ted talks', 'Lifestyle', 'English', 'ted']",2013-02-01T18:50:21Z,1061555,14555,,472,PT21M5S,true

When ready, browse vacation packages to Cusco: https://www.expedia.com/Cusco.d6053554.Destination-Travel-Guides

Step through time and worlds with a #vacation to #Cusco, the former capital of the Inca Empire of the Sun. Since the 16th century, Spanish colonial buildings were built atop former Inca Palaces, of which only foundations remain. 

In the Urubamba Valley, or #SacredValley, visitors can see the mysterious Moray Terraces and the pre-Inca Salt Mines of Maras. Ollantaytambo is a living Inca city and its towering ruins form the start of the Inca Trail to #MachuPicchu. 

The long-lost Inca bastion was uncovered from the jungle in 1911. It remains a mystery how the Incas managed to stack the heavy granite blocks that make up the city’s buildings so precisely, at high altitude.

Little is also known about how the Incas turned a multi-lingual tribal region in an empire that is now known as one of the greatest civilizations in history.

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

130,buVfghS3tKM,OnBoardHD,TRIP REPORT | The Emirates A380 Excellence! | Dubai to Madrid | Emirates Airbus A380,"Emirates Trip Report flying from Dubai to Madrid onboard one of the amazing Emirates Airbus A380 on a beautiful summer day over the Persian/Arabian Gulf and Europe.

A comfortable flight on the Emirates A380 from Dubai to Madrid. For the first time, I went on an Emirates A380 plane with no free seats next to me and I can say even this way, it's more comfortable than any other plane. What an amazing cabin!

Talking about the flight route, we took off from Dubai towards the south, and quickly after departure, we made an almost 180° turn back to Dubai.
The views of Dubai downtown were more than marvelous. They were just perfect! Finally, I had more than 30 seconds of the Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall without any turbulence! It was really amazing!

On today's flight, we took a southerly route. That means we flew over the Persian Gulf towards Bahrein, then Saudi Arabia and Jordania. We then entered the Mediterranean sea and flew directly to Creta island. From there we left Malta on our left and flew over Tunis. We entered the Peninsula over Valencia, already on direct course to Madrid, where we landed on runway 18L after a nice approach over the mountains.

About the catering service, there were 2 services. A ""continental breakfast"" (at least that's what they call an apple pastry and yogurt) and the main lunch. I went for the chicken option, with broccoli, rice, and tomato sauce. The other option was beef with mashed potatoes. That main meal included a pasta salad, some cheese and bread, and a dessert. Everything was tasty, but I had better meals onboard Emirates already. That being said, remember that Emirates in economy class is better than some others in business class.

Now it's your turn! Have you ever flown with Emirates? How was the experience? Which route did you fly? Have you been in Dubai? Maybe in Dubai? Have you ever flown on an Airbus A380? Which one do you prefer for flying with Emirates: the B777 or A380?
Lots of things to talk about! See you all in the comments!

131,mFzRhDLPo2o,OnBoardHD,TRIP REPORT | Emergency Landing on B747! | Frankfurt to Miami | Lufthansa Boeing 747-8i,"Lufthansa Trip Report flying from Frankfurt to Miami onboard one of the Lufthansa Boeing 747-8i on a lovely autumn morning.

Wow! What a flight... what initially looked like an absolutely standard flight over the Atlantic turned out to be the first medical diversion recorded on the channel. Once we were already cruising over the Atlantic Ocean, well into it, the crew started moving medical kits and the catering service was not performed. Later, we saw how the plane was making a 180° turn and, a few minutes later, the captain informed us that we were diverting to Lisboa due to a medical emergency. We soon saw as well how we were dumping fuel to reduce the weight to the limits to land in Lisboa.

We stayed 2h30min in Lisbon. The refueling took a lot. Probably they had to use small trucks to refuel this huge beast, and that led to the bug waiting time. Finally, we started pushback in Lisbon and started, again, our flight to Miami, now scheduled to be 8h15min. The views both on arrival and departure from Lisbon were truly amazing.

After departure from Lisbon, we turned left and started to fly over the Atlantic for the next 7 hours. Nothing special here, just water everywhere until reaching Florida. Due to the diversion to Lisbon, our flight ended in Miami already during the night, which allowed us to enjoy a really beautiful night approach.

However, when it seemed that the flight had had it all with the emergency onboard... destiny, once again, showed us why we should look out the window: just before starting the descent to Miami, we were able to watch the takeoff of a SpaceX Falcon 9 from our window!! It was spectacular and something that I'm sure I'll never see again... Just Amazing!

About the catering service, the crew first served some drinks, just after departing from Frankfurt. Then, they started the main catering service, but they only served the first rows, as the medical problem arose. In the end, we stayed more than 5 hours (+1h of boarding and little delay on departure) with only 2 glasses of drinks. It is not the crew's fault, but some water in Lisbon, for the more than 2h on the ground would have been a good option.

The main meal came just after reaching the cruise altitude on the flight from Lisbon to Miami. The typical mediocre Lufthansa catering: no options for the main course (just ravioli), a lettuce salad (the taste was with sauce), a cold bread roll, butter, and a piece of Bree cheese. The dessert was a tiny piece of artificial chocolate cake. Lufthansa has a lot to improve here, but it looks like they don't care too much about it.

All in all a really interesting flight with Lufthansa onboard the Queen of the Skies, the always amazing Boeing 747. For those that are new on the channel, you've probably only seen me criticizing Lufthansa. Those that are followers the channel for a long time know that I was a big fan of this airline. The service,  even on European flights, was among the best. Now it is just a bad joke of what Lufthansa used to be; now it's just another airline that accepts to offer a very mediocre service. They've lost the crown and they don't show any sign of sadness for that.

Now it's your turn! Have you ever flown with Lufthansa? Which route? On which plane? How was the experience? What do you think about the current Lufthansa onboard service? Have you ever flown on a Boeing 747 Have you ever had an Emergency landing? Have you ever seen a space rocket from a plane?

Not only is Malaysia a melting pot of ethnic cultures, but it is also a blend of many different customs, cuisines and religions all coexisting peacefully together. From large island groups to mountains and tropical rainforest, the country’s geography is every bit as diverse. What’s more, Malaysia is a unique country in that is divided into two main landmasses. West Malaysia occupies the southern half of a peninsula shared with Thailand, while East Malaysia is situated on the Borneo island.

In #RioDeJaneiro the Brazilian locals pile onto the beautiful beaches and express themselves through artwork, dance, and the ubiquitous Rio de Janeiro partying. 

Any Rio de Janeiro #tour must make a stop at Christ the Redeemer, the ubiquitous statue that watches over the city from above the Tijuca National Forest. Take the cable car to the lookout point on Sugarloaf Mountain, the city’s iconic peak, and try not to look down – it’s a long way to the ground!

After a morning spent in nature, your #vacation should continue back in the city. Join the sun worshippers at Copacabana, where you can stake out a patch of beach or float out to sea with the paddleboarders. Shop for souvenirs in Ipanema, or take part in the street dances, festivals, and parades that may spontaneously break out. 

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Ride the funicular to Ljubljana Castle, a beloved landmark that has been standing above the city for more than 900 years.Then head toPreseren Square, named after France Preseren, whose poem “A Toast” became the country’s national anthem. 

Stroll to nearbyCongress Squareand Park Zvezda. From here, you can see theUniversity of Ljubljana, one of the largest places of learning in Europe. 

Visit the Slovene Philharmonic Orchestra building, one of the world’s oldest musical institutions with famous connections to composers such as Beethoven and Brahms. 

Cross the Dragon Bridge, famous for its fearsome dragon statues, who’s tails are said to twitch when a pure and untouched maiden is nearby. 

Pick up a free bicycle rental and follow the Jokopic Promenade to the Tivoli Castle and check out the print collection at the International Centre of Graphic Arts.

Immerse yourself in art of a different kind in the Metelkova Mesto, a funky cultural zone, which hosts more than 1500 events each year.

Ljubljana may have taken a dragon as its symbol but unlike that mythical beast, this city is welcoming, warm and delighted to share its treasures with visitors.

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

146,UMM9FYZSW7Q,OnBoardHD,TRIP REPORT | First Time on Swiss A330! | Boston to Zurich | SWISS Airbus A330,"Swiss Trip Report flying from Boston to Zurich onboard one of the Swiss Airbus A330 on a beautiful night over the Atlantic and morning over Europe.

A comfortable flight onboard the Swiss Airbus A330-300 from Boston to Zurich. The A330 still offers the 2-4-2 seat configuration, which is perfect for those seated on the window seats. This was also my first time flying from Boston Airport and, of course, it's also for the channel.

After a nice planespotting session at Boston airport, we boarded our A330 and took off from Boston just a few minutes after the scheduled time of departure. Just a few seconds after liftoff we made a steep turn to the left and set course towards the North-Atlantic ocean. Ahead of us around 7 hours of flight. 

Around 3 hours after takeoff the Sunrise started in the middle of the North-Atlantic ocean. As always in these cases, it was me and Sunrise. Everyone on the plane was sleeping. It's a really magical moment. Everything is silent, nobody is moving.

Regarding the onboard service, the crew served just after departure the main catering service (dinner service). There were 2 options: pasta with vegetables or chicken with rice. I went for the chicken option. It came with a very basic salad (lettuce and carrot), bread, butter and cheese, and a little piece of cake as dessert. 

In general, it was quite good. Not the best, of course, but not the worst either. Definitely better than the main airline in the Lufthansa Group. As the portions weren't really big, I asked for another main meal. In this case, was the vegetarian option. The cake, by the way, was terrible. But I was so hungry that I decided to eat it in 2 bites just to fill my stomach for the next 6 hours. 

I would also like to mention that it's clear that these A330s are at the end of their career in Swiss: the IFEs are entirely outdated, there are no sockets (just a super-slow USB charger) and seats, although they were quite comfortable, they looked old. 

As a final conclusion, I would also like to point out that it's really sad to see how iconic airlines are downgrading more and more the economy class service. Looks like every airline touched by the Lufthansa Group got the order to cut costs to the max level. Lufthansa's service is just a joke compared to what it was. Swiss, from what I've seen in some old Trip Reports on Youtube is starting to follow the same path. I'm curious about how the Austrian Airlines long-haul service is. Luckily, we'll see it soon on the channel!

Now it's your turn! Have you ever flown with SWISS? Which route? How was the experience? Which plane do you prefer for long-haul? The A330 or the B777? Have you ever been in Zurich? Maybe in Boston? Have you ever done a transatlantic flight?
Lots of things to talk about! Read you all in the comments!

Travel video about destination Cabo Verde.
Cape Verde is an exotic island world, an archipelago off the coast of West Africa it combines the flair of the Canaries with the charm of Africa.  Explorers Christopher Columbus and Vasco Ad Gama lay anchor there in order to replenish supplies and repair their ships.  It was not until 1445 that the fifteen islands were discovered and consequently became a Portuguese colony. We begin in the north east of the islands, in Sal.  Crystal blue sea and endless sandy beaches, islands of both wind and sunshine with a volcanic lunar landscape twenty five kilometres long and twelve kilometres wide.  Sal owes its name and colonization to its once most important export of salt which was to be found in huge quantities. Baia Da Fontana, close to Palmeira, appears like a shady oasis with various green trees that provide welcome shelter from the heat and in the background the dominant Monte Leste volcano where the slopes reach down to the shore and the splendid rock pools of Buracona. Mindelo, situated on the island São Vicente, is considered to be the cultural centre of the archipelago in which typical Creole art has been preserved.  Sparse, raw and untamed it is dominated by powerful, almost mystical mountains. Santo Antão is an island of mountains, wind and water and the second largest island of Cape Verde.  Its most important route is a road over the high mountains.  The views of the Paúl Valley take the breath away.  A fairytale world of stone which looks truly surreal.  Against the background of the scenery, clouds entangle themselves within the mountains and provide life-giving moisture. Each island is unique and possesses its own special charm.  Cabo Verde - islands full of light and joie de vivre!

Not only is Malaysia a melting pot of ethnic cultures, but it is also a blend of many different customs, cuisines and religions all coexisting peacefully together. From large island groups to mountains and tropical rainforest, the country’s geography is every bit as diverse. What’s more, Malaysia is a unique country in that is divided into two main landmasses. West Malaysia occupies the southern half of a peninsula shared with Thailand, while East Malaysia is situated on the Borneo island.

Ethiopia is a mysterious, mountainous land in the Horn Of Africa and birthplace of Early Christianity.  A country of rock churches in the north and a large variety of tribes along the Rift Valley in the south and the oldest civilised region in Africa with more than twenty five centuries of documented history. Addis Abeba is the capital of Ethiopia and within its centre is the lavishly furnished Menbere Selassie Church, final place of rest of Ethiopia’s last royal family.  It contains the Empress Menen, two princes and Emperor Haile Selassie who, shortly after removal from power, died due to reasons that are in the main controversial. On many of its thirty seven islands, Lake Tana in Northern Ethiopia is well known for its ancient churches and monasteries.  Dega Stefanos is located in the centre of the lake and contains one of the country’s most important monasteries.  On the summit, framed by walls and hidden under great trees, is the Holy Stefanos Monastery and within a small sanctuary various mummies are preserved within glazed wooden coffins and the remains of five emperors of various dynasties lie at rest. Awash is a settlement on the edge of the nature park of the same name, inhabited by the Afar, a proud and independent tribe.  On market day, people from the surrounding area meet here.  For the Afar, life is hard and only the strong survive.  Corn, tobacco, dates and cotton are the main trading products of this region.  Dromedaries, sheep and goats are bred, and pastureland is often the subject of heated disputes. A journey through Ethiopia is also a journey through time itself.  A land of rich traditions, religions and myths.  A country of legends and contrast that possesses one of the most colourful histories on the African continent.

Just over an hour west of Scotland’s capital, Edinburgh, is the city of #Glasgow. 

#Explore this city’s unique blend of style and character at George Square, the center of it all. Looming over the city’s north-east are the brooding spires of Glasgow Cathedral. On the hill behind the cathedral lies Glasgow Necropolis, a timeworn Victorian cemetery. Just a 20-minute drive from the city center is Bothwell Castle, a remnant of the past. For those after a little more culture, an attraction which exemplifies Glasgow’s fascinating blend of the earthy and the elaborate is the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. Founded in 1451, the University of Glasgow is one of the oldest, and most distinguished, learning institutions in the world. 

From its rich history to its irreverent character, a #vacation to Glasgow will show you elements from all walks of life. 

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

168,J6FTmSyqXIc,Expoza Travel,Slovakia Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Slovakia.
Slovakia has a long and varied history and contains Europe’s youngest capital city and also its highest mountain range, as well as cultural masterpieces and unspoiled nature. Bratislava is located in the heart of Europe and is the capital of Slovakia. Surrounded by the City Hall and several palaces, it is like being taken back in time into a rich and glorious past. On the Danube’s Slovakian side, and to the east, is the town of Komárno.  In the old urban market square a Miniature Europe with forty five buildings has, in recent years, come into existence.  Towers, domes, arcades, half-timbered buildings and woodcarvings frame the square at whose centre is the Millennium Fountain.  It is a unique mixture of architecture that signifies the common culture of European countries.  Seven hundred metres above sea level, herds of sheep graze peacefully on the slopes of the Great Fatra, the location of the almost hidden and forgotten Vlkolĺnec, a unique village in the heart of Slovakia’s Liptov region.  Today it is tantamount to being an open-air museum. Further north is Terchová, birthplace of Slovakia’s national hero, Juraj Jánošík.  The legendary robber chief has an exhibition dedicated to him in which the living conditions and customs of that time are on display. The High Tatra is the smallest high mountain range in Europe.  A magnificent mountain landscape with rocky mountains and many lakes.  In 1947, the National Park of the same name was founded. Slovakia is a land of fortresses, castles and cities that date from the Middle Ages and, despite its many mountain regions, a southern-influenced way of life.

https://www.expedia.com/Death-Valley.d54985.Destination-Travel-Guides


If you’re thinking #DeathValley is little more than 5,000 square-miles of badlands all strung together with a whole lotta nothing in between, think again! Straddling the California-Nevada border, Death Valley is one of America’s great #vacation destinations. This is an American #roadtrip like no other, where each twist and turn throws up a new surprise.

Studded with many abandoned mines and crumbling ghost towns, Death Valley is the perfect place to blow the dust off America’s pioneering past. However, it’s the incredible diversity of the natural landscapes which really steals the show. From the lowest point in the USA to #mountains that rise over 11,000 feet, from vast salt pans to cool slot canyons, Death Valley is truly one of the world’s most breathtaking natural treasures.

But don’t just take our word for it. Sit back, press play and enjoy the astonishing sights, sounds and stories of Death Valley!

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

#Transylvania has long occupied the darker recesses of human imagination. Its fog-draped mountains and medieval castles inspired gothic novelist Bram Stoker, which resulted in the creation of his greatest villain, Count Dracula. His famous literary work caused an influx of tourism into this time-forgotten part of the world.  

However, travelers who #explore Transylvania’s stirring landscapes #discover more than just shadowy folklore. After enduring a long and bloody tug of war, Transylvania is now made up of a tapestry of cultures. Admire the shimmering Hungarian murals adorning the walls of the Targu Mures Cultural Palace. Roam among the crumbling ruins of Rasnov Fortress, where the Teutonic Knights defended against Turkish and Tartar invasion. And of course, wander the dark passageways and windswept ramparts of Bran Castle, Stoker’s inspiration for Dracula’s clifftop lair.

Whatever your pace, a #vacation to Transylvania will be sure to leave you completely captivated with this part of Eastern Europe.

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Learn some basics about the country, including what you have to do & see once you arrive, when it's best to travel and which food & drinks you definitely need to enjoy throughout your journey.
-----------------------------------------------
Canada is a stunning destination that provides travellers an endless natural playground to get lost in. From the incredible mountain ranges of British Columbia to the coves and cliffs of Canada's East Coast (and everywhere in between), the True North strong and free has it all.

The country is made up of 10 provinces and 3 territories, each with their own unique cultural backgrounds, adventurous activities and impressive landscapes. Consider booking a tour that focuses on a specific region so that you can experience it thoroughly - the country is huge, making it unlikely to able to enjoy everything if you rush across the country in a single trip. 

Remember to pack clothes appropriate for the province or territory you’re visiting. Depending on the season you travel, pack everything from your swimsuit to your parka. 

You can exchange your money into Canadian dollars in any major city, at airports or at the countless ATMs located throughout the country. Credit card and debit transactions are incredibly common, so in most case you will have no trouble using them in lieu of cash. Dining out doesn’t have to be expensive if you visit the right restaurants, and you'll have to cross off the classics like poutine, sugar pie and craft beer! 

We'd like to thank a few of Canada's incredible tourism boards for allowing use of their travel footage:

185,8FB8z58imvQ,Expoza Travel,Bali Paradise (Indonesia) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Bali Paradise in Indonesia.
Bali is part of the largest island kingdom in the world, the State of Indonesia. Denpasar has been the capital of Bali since 1946 and was once the seat of the homonymous principality of Badung. The small village situated around the Pemecutan Raja Palace, soon developed into a bustling city.  The city’s oldest Hindu temple dates from the fourteenth century and was established by the envoy of the Majapahit Empire. At the entrance to the Monkey Forest near the town of Ubud, the famous saint monkeys welcome those who come here.  The cheeky little macaques are thought to be descendants of mythical monkey king, Hanoman. Gamelan music and Legong dance are part of Bali’s culture. The movement of the body, and especially the position of the head, the play of the eyes and various facial expressions, each form the traditional elements of the dance. A journey to the centre of the island, from Sebali to Keliki, is a great experience and one not to be missed.  Uphill through small villages and lush greenery, past banana trees and paddy fields, typical Balinese country life. On the main island, in Kuta, are wonderfully spacious, white sandy beaches and the warm Indian Ocean, often with waves several metres high.  Here, relaxation is the order of the day and the waves attract surfers from all over the world. Bali is truly the Island of the Gods, with fantastic scenery, fascinating culture and exclusive hotels.

194,uJUlOLQShiw,Expoza Travel,Egypt Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Egypt.
Egypt is a land of monumental temples, gigantic pyramids, the River Nile and the mysterious Sphinx: 5000 years of history.Founded by Alexander The Great in 332 B.C., the city of Alexandria is located in the Nile Delta and it was here that Caesar and Mark Anthony fell under Cleopatra’s spell. Cairo is Africa’s largest city and the heart of the Arab world, extreme poverty living next to opulent wealth, and modern, Western boutiques next to ancient souks. The Cairo Museum is home to the most extensive collection of Egyptian antiquities, including the golden mask and tomb of Tutankamun. Towering above almost any other human achievement are the impressive three pyramids of Gisa. The Cheops Pyramid, the world’s largest single construction, took four hundred thousand workers twenty years to build. It weighs as much as all the cathedrals in Europe put together and spans an area of 53,000 square metres - the height of a fifty storey skyscraper. In the middle of today’s modern city of Luxor, known as the ‘Capital City Of The Pharaohs’, the Luxor Temple stretches along the eastern banks of the Nile and, not far away, the temple complex of Karnak and the Amun Temple. 67 kilometres from Luxor, on the western bank of the Nile, lies the Temple Of Dendera, the most important place of worship for the love goddess, HATHOR, whose heavenly appearance was portrayed by the body of a cow. At Aswan, the landscape of the Nile is enchanting, but it is the stone temples of Abu Simbel that take one back to ancient Egypt, land of the Pharaohs, and archaeological paradise.

The Onomea Bay Scenic Drive, located along the Hamakua Coast, will take you past shimmering emerald rainforest and astonishing glimpses of the tranquil Pacific Ocean. It’s the perfect place to get some pictures and see what the beauty of Hawaii is really about.

No #tour of Hawaii’s Big Island is complete without meeting the sea turtles of Kahalu’u Bay. Strap on your snorkel and swim around the warm, blue-green waters of the bay to meet turtles and thousands of other sea creatures. 

Try out paddleboarding, jet skiing, or a variety of other watersports. Alternatively, spoil yourself in the time-honored indulgence of relaxing on the black lava sands, soaking up some of the legendary Hawaiian sunshine.

When ready, browse vacation packages to Bolivia: https://www.expedia.com/Bolivia.d21.Destination-Travel-Guides 

A #vacation to #Bolivia, a landlocked South American country, holds the promise of discovery for adventurous souls. While pretty Sucre is Bolivia’s judicial capital, La Paz is its political capital and also its main tourist hub.

Journey high to the Mirador Laikacota for city views. Deep in the valley below #visit the central Plaza Murillo, home to the most precious buildings: the Presidential Palace, National Congress and Metropolitan Cathedral. Stay near the Plaza San Francisco for its proximity to hidden gems, such as the curious Witches’ Market, the Musical Instrument Museum and the Coca Museum.

Bolivia is a diamond in the rough; relatively undeveloped, but extremely authentic, colorful and cultural. Bolivia’s riches shine through in the country’s high altiplanos, its floating reed islands on Lake Titicaca, the silver mines of Potosi, the infinite salt flats of the Salar de Uyuni and the untamed tropical lowlands in the vast Amazon basin.

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Travel video about destination India.
India is a subcontinent with a long history, a land of legend, fantasy and reality.A country that extends from the Himalayas in the north to the semi-desert terrain and tropics of the south. A place of incredible contrasts and fascinating splendour. Delhi is the political and administrative capital of India and a melting pot of both culture and religion. A constantly expanding metropolis built on the site of twelve former cities and centre of power for almost a thousand years. Jama Masjid, the Friday Mosque, is one of ancient Delhi’s main landmarks that was bequeathed to the city by the mogul king, Shah Jahan and close to the mosque is the bazaar district of Chandni Chowk, a busy commercial area. The white temples of Ranakpur are the sanctuaries of the Jains and are situated in a picturesque valley to the west of the Aravalli Mountains north of Udaipur. At around the same time that Buddhism was introduced to the area, Jainism also arrived, the religion of the country’s great hero, Mahavira. Rajasthan is the Land Of The Maharajas in all its splendour, a living fairytale beneath the desert sky. Agra was once the imposing metropolis of the mogul monarchy and today the city has lost nothing of its mediaeval atmosphere. Calcutta, or Kolkata, as it has been known since 2001, is the capital of West Bengal and also the second largest city in India. A city of contrasts that could not be more striking. Each morning hundreds of people go to the Howrah Bridge to bathe on the banks of the Hooghly River, a tributary of the sacred River Ganges. In 1853 Bombay had its first railroad and the Indian rail network was soon extended. The Victoria Terminus was built, one of the most impressive train stations in the world. Incredible India, a remarkable country that has always fascinated travellers by the amazing diversity of its people, culture and landscapes.

Travel video about destination Chile.
Chile was given its name by the Incas who respectfully called it Chili, ‘the country in the south’. Santiago De Chile, the capital of Chile, is dignified, modest and European-looking and also lively, modern and full of Latin temperament.  The Plaza De Armas is the heart of the city and the historic centre of colonial Santiago that contains the city’s most important buildings. The city of Valparaiso or, Paradise Valley, is around a hundred and twenty kilometres from the capital of Santiago De Chile on the Pacific coast.  The city’s development was closely connected with its harbour which brought it wealth and power.  Since the middle of the nineteenth century, escalators have rattled up and down the steep hills of the harbour city with forty five hills flanking the bay, each of them covered with a number of tiny wooden huts. Only a short journey on a gravel road and the Atacama Desert begins.  At its centre it is the driest desert in the world where the forces of nature have turned it into an extraordinary landscape.  The Atacama extends between the Pacific Ocean and the Cordilleras, an area of stone and sand that is perforated only by various frequently dried out salt lakes. For those ships that sailed around Cape Horn, Ancud represented a safe harbour on the journey north in which they could rest after sailing the stormy waters of the South Pacific.  At a time when whales and seals were hunted in the Antarctic, Ancud served as a supply station along the route to the southern Polar sea. From the Atacama Desert in the north to as far as the stormy Tierra Del Fuego in the south, Chile is a country rich in contrast.  Volcanoes, arid deserts, salt lakes, lively geysers, sandstone mountains and a cosmopolitan city.  All of this is to be found in Chile, a country at the end of the world!

Finland is a land of a thousand lakes and eternal forests, a land of log cabins and Orthodox churches - a midsummer’s dream in the extreme north of Europe.Helsinki, ‘The Daughter of the Baltic’, ‘The Gibraltar of the North’, a dividing line between east and west and a modern and liberal minded metropolis. Founded in 1550 by Swedish king, Gustav Vasa, as a trading centre, in 1812 Tsar Alexander The First made it the capital of the Principality Of Finland. Turku is the oldest city in Finland and is the country’s first capital city from where Finnish culture was born. It is still evocative of the Middle Ages. The sea, a magnificent island landscape and picturesque timber houses are typical of one of the oldest cities in the Gulf Of Bothnia, Uusikaupunki. It was there in 1712 that a peace treaty was signed between Russia and Sweden and this small, quiet town has a long maritime history. Further north is a town of seafarers and traders, Kokkola, of which the old town boasts the largest number of timber built houses in Finland. The cleric, Anders Chydenius, once lived here and laid the foundation of Liberalism, the freedom of both religion and trade. Oulu is the flourishing centre of Northern Finland. Along with its many green areas this city by the sea comes alive during the spring and summer months. Despite the harsh climate, tropical plants are popular in the city. The hilly landscape of the spacious Pallas Ounastunturi National Park is located in the north west, close to the Swedish border. Yellow-green reindeer moss and dense layers of many other varieties grow on the seemingly endless hills of primeval stone and gneiss. The plant life of this region always surprises those who encounter it for the first time. Finland is a country that boasts more lakes than any other. It is full of picturesque, natural beauty, unique cultural treasures and historic locations: a tranquil paradise set in the extreme north.

Ecuador is one of the most diverse countries in the world though it's comparably tiny. Beside the Galapagos Islands (which is the #1 tourist destination in Ecuador) the country has a lot more to offer, therefore I focussed on ""La Sierra"" in this video which is a paradise for landscape lovers and outdoor adventurers.

Another reason to visit the Andean region is that you have the chance to dive into the local culture and get a real feeling of Ecuador. The places to see in Ecuador I focussed on in this short video are the result of my own travels along the center from north to south and are easily doable in 2 weeks time.

Things to do in Ecuador covered in this video:
01) 00:36 - Otavalo market in Otavalo
02) 01:00 - Hike the Cuicocha lake
03) 01:25 - Middle of the World, Mitad del Mundo & Quitsato in Cayambe
04) 01:48 - Quito, capital & UNESCO World Heritage
05) 02:08 - Termas de Papallacta (hot springs)
06) 02:24 - Cayambe Coca National Park
07) 02:45 - Quilotoa & Shalala viewpoint
08) 03:13 - Tren Crucero & Nariz del Diablo (Devil's nose)
09) 03:47 - Inka ruins in Ingapirca
10) 04:04 - Cuenca & it's beautiful old town

What are your best things to do in Ecuador?
I’m looking forward to more tips from other travelers and Ecuador experts. Have you been and know of some cool places? Let us know in the comments below!

Of course, San Francisco #sightseeing isn’t complete without an excursion to Alcatraz, the island prison that once held some of the country’s most notorious criminals. Look into its empty cells and thick stone walls and wonder, could you escape “The Rock”?

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

After our roadtrip through Iceland 2 years ago Gareth and I were in search of a destination that offers just as much natural beauty and unique outdoor experiences as Iceland and ended up choosing Norway because of its rugged coastline featuring numerous huge fjords and thousands of picturesque islands.

Regarding our route we’ll be starting off in Stavanger in Southwest Norway to learn more about the history of the country before moving on to Odda for some proper winter trekking. After that we make our way to Bergen, one of the most picturesque cities of the country which is often referred to as the fjord capital. Then we hit the slopes in Myrkdalen together with a well known Winter-X-Games athlete to warm up for the next dream destination further up north in Northern Norway: the Lofoten islands, which we’ll be exploring properly from west to east. The capital Oslo will be our last stop to finish this trip in style by visiting some of the major sights of the city and attending an intense football derby.

226,KZPqcy7F2dA,Expoza Travel,Mexico Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Mexico.
Mexico, land of the Maya and Aztec, temples and beaches and with a population of twenty-six million the bubbling metropolis of Mexico City is a maze of streets, flat roofs, skyscrapers and parks. Earthquakes, floods and civil wars created this ‘City Of The Aztecs’. Templo Mayor, the main temple of the Aztecs, lies in the centre of the city, in the large main square, Zocalo. The magnificent Catedral Metropolitana with its massive dimensions and fine stone masonry dominates the square, with equal prominence being given to the Palacinio Nacional, governmental seat of the Mexican President. In 1519, when the Spanish conquerors reached Tenochtitlan, capital of the Aztec kingdom, they discovered a lagoon paradise with floating gardens, Xochimilco, a labyrinth of lakes and canals, which today can be explored by boat. Known as the Pearl Of The Pacific, Acapulco is a world famous holiday resort of the rich and famous where luxury liners dock each day and endless golden sands beckon a swim under the Caribbean sun. Each evening, the famous cliff jumpers of Acapulco congregate when, from a height of 42 metres, they jump fearlessly from the top of the La Quebrada Cliff into the narrow bay below. In the legendary ruins of Palenque, numerous monuments of the Maya culture can be found such as a palace, and several pyramids and temples. From the air, there is a unique view of the lush growth of the impenetrable forests around Palenque, and of Mexico’s most beautiful waterfalls of Agua Azul. Chichen Itza is thought to have been built by the Mayas around 450 AD and over 500 years later the fighting TOLTEKEN took over the deserted city, which led to two hundred years of prosperity. Located in the north, Tequila is situated at the foot of the likewise named volcano and is world famous because it is here that the Mexican national drink is produced. But Mexico is much more than a drink…it is a feast for all the senses!

232,lF8byCyRJ2g,Expoza Travel,London (United Kingdom) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"✱ 12800 Hotels in London - Lowest Price Guarantee ► https://booki.ng/2DFsetA

Travel video about destination London in England.
London is an exciting and pulsating metropolis of the new millennium, a melting pot of both people and culture and a fascinating city of diverse contrasts.

The City Of London contains the Tower, an historic landmark with a remarkable history. A mighty medieval fortress with 13 towers that throughout its 900 years, has served many functions and from the Middle Ages, it was a heavily fortified prison.

After the medieval St. Paul's Cathedral was destroyed by a devastating fire in 1666, Christopher Wren was ordered to re-build it with a dome. During the 36 years of its construction, its design was frequently altered until finally a wonderful masterpiece of church architecture was created.

The Monument is the city's tallest freestanding stone column and a reminder of the Great Fire of London that destroyed 80 percent of the city. In four days, more than 13,000 buildings were destroyed and the Monument was built on the site of the bakery in which the fire began.

Since the reign of Queen Victoria, Buckingham Palace has served as London's royal residence. A garden of mulberry trees once grew on the site of today's palace and the Duke of Buckingham subsequently added a simple brick built residence. Around 60 years later, George II purchased the site for his wife and George IV eventually began to design an extensive palace complex.

The highlight of any holiday in London must be the largest Ferris wheel in the world, the London Eye. Situated on the banks of the Thames, it rises high into the sky, opposite the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben.

The former centre of the largest empire in the world, London is still a city of superlatives that attracts millions of visitors each year. Exciting both day and night, London is a modern city with age old traditions and a long and colorful history.

When ready, browse vacation packages to Honolulu: https://www.expedia.com/Honolulu.d1488.Destination-Travel-Guides

Welcome to #Honolulu, Hawaii’s capital found on the island of Oahu. Whether you’re here to live the life of a beach bum or want to explore the city’s lush tropical surroundings, you’ll find everything you’re looking for on your Honolulu #vacation.

Hawaii had a pretty explosive inception—Diamond Head Crater, also called Leahi, started life as an active volcano. Don’t worry; it’s since gone dormant, which means you can climb to the rim and take in a truly brilliant view of the coast. 

Head to the water and go paddleboarding or swimming; “Honolulu” means “sheltered bay,” and the beachfront here lives up to its name: It’s calm and sheltered year-round. 

Honolulu #sightseeing must include a day at Pearl Harbor, and a #visit downtown to take in Honolulu’s history. 

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Travel video about destination Costa Rica.
Costa Rica is a fascinating country in Central America bordered by Nicaragua and Panama, a natural paradise between the Caribbean and the Pacific.Located at more than a thousand metres above sea level, San José, Costa Rica’s capital city, not only boasts an idyllic location in the heart of Central America’s coffee country, but also an enviable climate. The extent to which Costa Rica joins with European tradition can be seen in the Teatro Nacional.  The coffee barons, to whom the glorious development of San José is owed, created taxes for the export of coffee beans and thus funded the construction of the magnificent building. In a fertile mountain valley at the foot of a volcano, is Turrialba, a town that radiates a serene calm but once was an important station on the route of the Jungle Train from San José  to the Atlantic coast. The crater of the Poas Volcano is surrounded by the dense green of a rainforest and overlooks the north western Meseta Central.  Although it is one of the country’s most active volcanoes, it is the most visited, as visitors can go by car almost to the edge of the crater. The Rain Forest Aerial Tram is Costa Rica’s most popular tourist attraction, a ride on an open gondola through the jungle.  A journey of discovery amid a canopy of trees, hovering at treetop level through the solitude of nature. Fascinating nature, joie de vivre and colonial history are omnipresent on this land bridge between North and South America, Costa Rica is surely one of the most beautiful countries in the world.

An Atlanta #vacation must include the Atlanta History Center. Learn about the city’s roots as a railway terminal, as well as its role in the Civil War, when it was nearly burned to the ground. 

Stop by the Martin Luther King Jr. Historic Site to learn about the Civil Rights leader, and pay your respects at his final resting place. From there, your Atlanta #sightseeing should continue at the Georgia Aquarium, where you can see some beluga whales and whale-sharks, and meet sealife in the touch tanks. 

Cap off a beautiful day with a trip to Stone Mountain Park. If you take the Summit Skyride, you’ll get an outstanding view of the city.

244,4APFqo9wU9s,Through My Lens,Blue Ridge Parkway Road Trip: 4 Days Exploring America's Favorite Drive,"The Blue Ridge Parkway is pretty much the perfect American Road Trip. The parkway runs 469 miles from Cherokee, North Carolina to Waynesboro, Virginia. Along the way there is not a single stop sign or stoplight and you can cruise at 45 miles per hour the entire way. The parkway is full of pullouts for viewpoints, hikes, history and waterfalls, leading to many great adventures along the drive. We set out on a 4 day Blue Ridge Parkway road trip and had a blast experiencing this unique area. Here is how we spent 4 days driving the Blue Ridge Parkway.

When ready, browse vacation packages to Canberra: https://www.expedia.com/Canberra.d6049663.Destination-Travel-Guides

Canberra is a city which honors Australia’s past and shapes its future, yet #Canberra is far more than a political capital. 

At the heart of Canberra’s creation story is Lake Burley Griffin. In 1911, the government launched an international design competition seeking a master plan for a brand new city. The victor, Chicago architect Walter Burley Griffin, won with a garden city design focused on a man-made lake which fits perfectly within the landscape. When, the nation’s Governor General stood in a dusty paddock in 1913 and announced the name of the new capital, he told the nation that the city had, lying before it, a splendid destiny. 

Over 100 years later, that destiny has been fulfilled in a city that preserves the great chapters of Australia’s history and continues on to the next. #Vacation here to become a part of it, and keep the memories of your #visit for your own story. 

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Tibet is a relatively little known and mysterious land of snow high up in the Himalayas that borders Nepal, Bhutan ad India. It is protected by the highest mountains in the world and is a region that has developed a unique society whose philosophy, art and religious faith have earned much interest and respect.Lhasa is the capital of Tibet and also its largest city. The Barkhor Road extends for eight hundred metres around the Jokhang Temple and nearby Tsuklakhang Square. For the faithful a visit to the Jokhang Temple is the highlight of a long and arduous pilgrimage and the Dalai Lama once sat in its inner courtyard during the monks’ annual final examination, which was also a splendid festive event. On the other side of the Chakpori, a small mountain opposite Potala, is the seldom visited Sang Gya Thong Ku Temple that is somewhat hidden away and therefore off the tourist trail. This ‘temple of a thousand images of god’ is nevertheless very popular among devout Buddhists and is a place of silent prayer. The Yarlung Valley is full of history such as possessing the oldest field in Tibet, as well as the oldest village that is located at the foot of the country’s oldest fortress, Yom Bu La Khang, the rock palace of the country’s first mystic king. One of the largest monuments in Tibetan architecture is the unique Kumbum Chörten, a three-dimensional mandala that can be entered. Eyes decorate the upper part of the Stupa. The ritual walkabout begins on the lowest level with simple deities then follows the entire Pantheon of Tibet, immortalised in both sculptures and wall paintings. Despite Chinese influence, Tibet is still a religiously devout country with a fascinating monastery culture and amazing natural scenery. Tashi Delek! Happiness and Blessings!On the “roof of the world” one is always close to the gods…!...

Travel video about destination Hawaii.
The Hawaiian Islands are located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and form the 50th state of the USA. In the south east of the island of O’Ahu, Honolulu is a modern town and the starting point for most journeys. It also contains the Iolani Palace - once the residence of King David Kalakana -a magnificent Victorian structure in the centre of Honolulu and the only royal palace in the United States. In Pearl Harbour, a museum commemorates the events of the seventh of December 1941 when most of the American Pacific fleet was destroyed by the Japanese. The valley of Nuuanu Pali is of great importance in Hawaiian history. It was here that a deciding battle took place, when King Kamehameh came from Maui and triumphantly drove the troops of the chief of Oahu into the mountains, the result of which formed the political union of the Hawaiian Islands. In winter, the world’s best surfers collect on Sunset Beach, attracted by spectacular waves, some of which reach as high as the tallest church steeples. On the island of Kaua’i, the Wailua is Hawaii’s only navigable river and it flows through some of the exciting locations which were used for Jurassic Park, Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Blue Hawaii. Two volcanoes dominate the extraordinary island of Maui, which also features sandy beaches, green pastures, dense jungle and a bleak lunar-like landscape. On Waimea Beach in 1778, the English sea captain, James Cook, was the first European to set foot on Hawaiian territory. The Waimea Canyon was referred to by Mark Twain as ‘The Grand Canyon of the Pacific’, a massive gorge which has been carved out of the volcanic landscape by the Waimea River. From a Victorian style station there is the narrow-gauge Sugar Cane Train which travels through the once prolific sugar plantations of Kaanapali. Haleakale is the world’s largest dormant volcano with a crater as large as Manhattan. But nowhere else in the world can volcanoes be studied as safely as on Big Island in the Hawaiian Volcanoes National Park The Hawaiian Islands…priceless pearls in the Pacific Ocean.

China’s Imperial City is located in the centre of its ancient Middle Kingdom, a gigantic and inscrutable empire beyond the Great Wall. The Imperial City is entered through the Gates of Heavenly Peace.After seven years of construction, Ming Emperor Zhu Di moved into his newly-established palace complex in which over eight thousand people lived in almost a thousand rooms. The palace served as both a residential and governmental seat to the emperors of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. A stone’s throw away from the old Summer Palace is the Garden of Harmonious Unity that was the favourite garden of the Emperor’s household who retreated to its cool lakeside shores during the humid months of summer. Close to Badaling the Great Wall Of China extends majestically across misty mountains. It is the largest Man-made structure in the world and was erected to protect the country from invasion from the North. The gigantic wall represented the division of two very different cultures. On one side the Central Asian Nomads and on the other the highly developed civilisation of the emerging Chinese Empire. Shanghai is a Gigantic City and a meeting point of both east and west. The shoreline is without a doubt the city’s main focal point and is a combination of past, present and future and contains the historic monuments and eye catching buildings of a great city. Famous explorer Marco Polo referred to Suzhou as the ‘Venice of the East’, a city that is particularly famous for its gardens. Many of its extremely elegant buildings are remnants of a glorious past. Yunnan´s most famous site is the unique Stone Forest Of Shi Lin, a forest of rock that extends for 27,000 hectares. Hong Kong is a city of the superlative with glimmering skyscrapers that seem to take root in the sky and one elegant building after another with shining glass and hi-tech facades. China is a world within a world!

A #LongIsland #vacation sends you eastward from the New York boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens to the bluffs of Montauk Point. A short train ride from Manhattan is Long Beach, which for many is where Long Island begins. Visit Fire Island Lighthouse, which for generations of immigrants was their first glimpse of America. It was on Long Island’s northern shores where the mansions were built that would inspire F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic, The Great Gatsby.
 
#Visit the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Hempstead and continue your flight into the past at the American Airpower Museum. #Explore the pioneer settlement of Southampton Village and nearby Sag Harbor, a historic whaling port immortalized in Moby Dick.

Climb to the top to take in the sweeping views of this place that has played center stage in some of America’s greatest stories.

264,IguTMV4LfK4,Expoza Travel,Canada From Coast To Coast Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Traveling with the train through entire Canada.
Halifax is the capital of the province of Nova Scotia and the oldest British settlement in Canada.  One of the most impressive ways to explore Canada is to travel by train.   The journey across the second largest country in the world begins at the train station close to Halifax Harbour and travels from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast covering thousands of miles.  The trains of today’s Via Rail are both comfortable and nostalgic and their elevated panoramic windows provide an excellent view of Canada’s remarkable scenery. Quebec was founded in 1608 by famous explorer Samuel De Champlain but  the city’s most well known and prominent landmark is the 19th century Chateau Frontenac Hotel, the traditional stopover hotel of the Canadian Pacific Railway that offers first class service plus a lavish and historical ambience. Québec’s historic buildings, various gates, city walls and old houses that date back to the18th and 19th centuries are still in remarkably good condition.  Up until the late 18th century the city was a French possession but following several decades of hostilities the British finally conquered the city. In Montréal the architecture of bygone times blends in with the modern skyscrapers of today. Around three million people live in Canada’s second largest city, the biggest French-speaking metropolis outside France.  The Ville Souterraine, Underground City is an amazing world of shops and extends for almost thirty kilometres with a large network of tunnels, magnificent shopping arcades, hotel and cinema complexes and two thousand retail stores. The next stop on this journey across Canada is Toronto, one of the fastest growing cities in North America.   A prominent landmark is the fabulous CN Tower, the highest freestanding tower in the world.  Nearby is another spectacular building, the Skydome, a huge multi-purpose arena that can seat seventy thousand spectators and is home to the city’s baseball team, the Toronto Blue Jays. Niagara Falls, The Rocky Mountains and the last stop on the journey, Vancouver – one of the most beautiful cities in the world – Canada is a truly vast paradise in a fast-changing world!

When ready, browse vacation packages to Hobart: https://www.expedia.com/Hobart.d6052485.Destination-Travel-Guides

The onetime penal colony of #Hobart is located between Mount Wellington and Port Hobart, and features a number of exquisite colonial buildings in breathtaking natural surroundings. 

There’s a variety of things to do on #vacation in the city, so chow down on seafood from a waterfront restaurant before stopping by one of the galleries built into old whale oil warehouses. Don’t forget to check out the Hobart Theatre, a must-see on any Hobart tour. 

Hobart #sightseeing will no doubt include the Maritime Museum, which celebrates Hobart’s ties to the sea. Go for a sail on the Lady Nelson, a tall ship that makes regular excursions out to the harbor. 

Head to MONA, the Museum of Old and New Art. This building descends three floors down into the cliffs surrounding it, and its often dark-natured artwork is featured in vast, cavernous spaces. 
 
For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

273,Cwo9nHGtJeQ,Expoza Travel,Macedonia Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Macedonia.
Macedonia is a young Balkan republic that is a combination of both Orient and Occident. Skopje is the capital of Macedonia and is located in the Vardar River Valley.  It has a dramatic history that spans many thousands of years and forms the junction of two trading routes in southeast Europe that unite both western and eastern civilisation. The legacy of Ottoman times is omnipresent in Skopje.  One of the city’s most well-preserved mosques is that of the Gazi-Isisa-Bey Djamia and in the  seventeenth century it is believed that there were up to a hundred and twenty mosques in the city.  Ottoman rule began in 1392 and lasted for more than five hundred years. Near the village of Glumovo is the Bogorodica Monastery that was founded in the fourteenth century and is active again today.  The mediaeval frescos on the walls and ceilings are well preserved after five centuries. Southwest of Prilep is the ancient city of Stibera that is also known as Macedonian Pompeii.  It is in a good location on an important road.  The last Macedonian king, Perseus, had his military headquarters in Stibera during his struggles with Rome. In the south, just a few kilometres from the Greek border, is Bitola, at the foot of Pelister Mountain and on the edge of the fertile Pelagonija Plains.  Buildings with Neo-Baroque and Renaissance facades, huge mosques and splendid diplomatic residences indicate the city’s importance. Macedonia is a wild land full of natural splendour and with a long and dramatic history that is well worth more than just a flying visit.  Indeed, this visit also features a Galička wedding that is a fine example of colourful tradition and local culture.

The north coast of this city began as a #vacation retreat in the 1850s and maintains its position as the Gold Coast’s heart and soul of entertainment and surfing. The south coast has a slower vibe and is a bit more relaxed. 

Remember that Gold Coast also happens to be the theme park capital of Australia, which helps drive Gold Coast tourism and serves as a nice complement to the lazy beach life. 

Top off your trip down under with a #visit to Mount Tamborine, a 30-minute drive inland from the coast. On the ridge of a volcano, Mount Tamborine offers a bounty rainforest trails.

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Taiwan, the Beautiful Island or, ‘Ilha Formosa’: a land of gods, spirits and temples - an island at the end of a rainbow! This south east Asian island is separated from the Chinese mainland by the Formosa Strait that at its narrowest point is a hundred and thirty kilometres wide. Taipei is a pulsating metropolis in the north of the island in which emperors’ treasures and chaotic traffic highlight both industrial strength and a Chinese way of life. In the old town district of Wan Hua is the city’s oldest and most precious Buddhist temple of Lungshan Szu, the Dragon Mountain Temple. The Sun Yi Sen Memorial Hall was built to commemorate the centenary of the founder of the Republic of China. His efforts brought about the abdication of the last emperor and the birth of the Republic Of China. The Confucius Temple is a place of contemplation and is a replica of the Temple Of Qu Fu, Qu Fu having been the home town of Confucius. This silent place is one of five temples in Taiwan dedicated to the great Chinese philosopher, Confucius, the founder of a religion that even today has many followers. The past importance of the former Taiwanese capital of Tainan is indicated by the city’s many temple complexes that contain an abundance of sacred works of art. Religion still plays a central role in the daily life of the people and the Tien Gon Temple is the most important temple in Taiwan. Taiwan is an island full of magical charm, fascinating works of art and breathtaking natural wonders. The legacy of Confucius mixed with the bright hope of the future. A symbiosis of industrialisation and Chinese tradition. The success of capitalism confirmed by the eternal words, “Made in Taiwan“!

Rising from the republic’s rolling hills is Mount Titano, where the country’s founder, Saint Marinus, sought refuge in the 3rd Century. Over the centuries, three towers were built to ward off invaders; today these towers watch over a country overflowing with history, culture and beauty.

Just beyond the towers lies the republic’s ancient capital, San Marino City. The heart and soul of this city is Liberty Square, home to the Statue of Liberty and the Palazzo Pubblico. Wherever you turn you’ll see tributes to the republic’s founder, no more so than in San Marino Basilica, where the bones of the saint now rest beneath the altar. 

San Marino is a welcoming escape for lovers of art and history, and a tax-free haven for shoppers.

When ready, browse vacation packages to New York City: https://www.expedia.com/New-York.dx178293


#NewYorkCity is an international metropolis built on the shoulders of immigrants and their descendants.

The city is home to eight million people, and receives more than 50 million visitors per year. Your New York City #vacation should include sampling the food of hundreds of different cultures. You can easily #explore on foot, by taxi, or via the famous subway system.

No New York #sightseeing is complete without a visit to Times Square, which you’ve no doubt seen in many movies. Take in its billboards, its many people, and its food, then cross over to Central Park, which comprises 850 acres of lakes and meadows, and is the setting for many a romantic comedy. 

You also have your pick of art and history museums, as well as the Reflecting Absence Memorial and Museum, where you can pay your respects to the victims of 9/11.


For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Also known as “The Top End,” #Darwin perches on the Timor Sea, giving it striking views of the ocean. Due to its distance from other Australian cities, it is somewhat isolated, leading to a real sense of small-town community despite its status as a large city. 

Get a taste of this community during your Darwin #vacation by stopping at the Mindil Beach Markets; on Thursdays and Sundays, you can run into almost half the city as residents turn out to shop at the various vendors and devour local multicultural cuisine.

Get outdoors at Crocadylys Park, which is filled with Darwin’s legendary salt and freshwater crocodiles. The Darwin region is home to over 20 national parks, so you can get a taste of the Australian outback without venturing too far from civilization. 

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

When ready, browse vacation packages to Belfast: https://www.expedia.com/Belfast.d6034919.Destination-Travel-Guides

Scattered throughout the countryside of #Belfast, you’ll find Iron Age forts, medieval castles, and more modern construction dating to the 20th century. Belfast got on the fast track to modernizing in the 19th century, when it became known as a shipbuilding mecca. Among the famous vessels built at Belfast through the decades are the RMS Titanic and its sister ships, Olympic and Britannic. 

A great deal of Belfast’s modern identity stems from over three decades of political and religious strife. These issues have influenced much of the city’s public art, as a great number of murals and statues depict people and events from those times. 

Belfast makes a great #vacation destination. The city is easily navigable on foot, and you never know what sort of delightful gallery, park, or restaurant you’re going to find just around the bend. 

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

My trip to Egypt was nothing short of incredibly challenging and extremely fulfilling. From the historic Pyramids of Giza and Luxor Temple, to the amazing Egyptian food and wildly entertaining people, this was truly a trip of a lifetime.

Here is my Ultimate Egypt Travel Guide in Q&A Form:

IS EGYPT SAFE?

Yes. If we compare Egypt to let's say Brazil, I think it is very safe. In many places around Latin America you have to be worried about being robbed at gunpoint, car jacked, pickpocketed and much more.

In Egypt, you just have to look out for scammers, hecklers, gawkers, and people trying to sell you things or get undeserved tips from you. That is my very short answer.

*See my episode ""Is Egypt Safe for Women"" for more information.

IS EGYPT EXPENSIVE?

No. As I explain in the video; you can find good quality hotels in Cairo, Luxor, Aswan, and across Egypt for a good price. Tours are affordable, and transportation can also be done on a budget. Entrance fees and tips can add up, so just be aware of that.

You just need to be aware of people trying to charge you more money on small things.

Food costs will be between $3-10 USD per meal, and Uber is the best and cheapest way to get around.

IS IT DIFFICULT TO FILM? HOW WERE THE POLICE?

We did not have trouble filming at all. We were usually either with local friends or a tour guide, and they opened many doors for us. We filmed as low-key as possible, and we removed our microphones for the majority of our trip. We also did not bring drones.

As for Egyptian Police, we truly did not have any issues. Whenever necessary, I explained that I was an American photographer or YouTuber and they were honestly just excited. 

Tyler and I also traveled with very limited gear as to not intimidate anyone, and we filmed with our iPhones wherever necessary.

IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS, PLEASE COMMENT THEM BELOW AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM!!

I hope you enjoyed this Egypt Travel Guide as much as we did making it!  ❤️ If so, please hit that ""👍"" button, and leave a comment!

See ya next week!

308,yI5uBjyTHxY,TourRadar,"Morocco Travel Guide: Marrakech, Atlas Mountains and Essaouira","On this trip you’ll be heading to Marrakech, the heart of Morocco, where spices linger in the market air, the sun sets on street performers, and the senses are treated to a whirlwind of sights and sounds. Discover life in the sprawling medina or get lost in the alleyways towards the souqs. Marvel at the tilework found in the royal Bahia Palace and Dar Si Said or learn how ancient traditions are woven into the fabric of Marrakech; there’s more than one way to fall in love with this cosmopolitan city.

Morocco is a North African country renowned for diversity, and this is one of the things that make it such a fascinating destination to visit. It’s a place where one will find many cultural influences, and the landscape offers visitors a chance to experience the ocean, Atlas Mountain peaks and the Sahara Desert all in one go. You might be travelling to one country, but in Morocco, there is a whole world to explore.

In Essaouira discover how coastal winds and different tribes can shape a port city. It’s a melting pot with Arab, Berber and European influences. While the sea attracts windsurfers, culture vultures flock to the medina’s alleyways for galleries and a spot of people watching. The vibrancy found in the country’s cities is matched by life in the Middle Atlas Mountains, where visitors can swap people watching and fortified walls for hiking, folk music and stargazing.

Observe nomadic shepherds, hike through limestone river canyons, enjoy impressive views and Berber hospitality and warmth as you make Midelt your basecamp for the Middle Atlas Mountains. As the sun goes down on the soaring peaks, the stars will light up the skies.

If we’ve inspired you to explore this north African country further, head over to TourRadar for all the different ways you can discover a world of flavour, culture and history in Morocco.

Embark on a Quebec City #tour around the colonial buildings in Dufferin Terrace, the history at Battlefields Park, and the stunning beauty of Montmorency Falls. From the Saint Lawrence River to Fontaine de Tourny, there are endless attractions to experience in Quebec’s capital city.

South Korea, located on the peninsula between Japan and China, is a nation of contradictions. You’ll find an ancient culture that goes back thousands of years, bolstered by high-tech industries and glowing modern cities. These elements, seemingly at odds, often mix together to create a truly unique experience.

Your Korea tour begins with Seoul, a mega-city full of theatres, casinos, restaurants, and pubs. If you love shopping, you’re in luck: Korea loves nothing better than offering a chance for some good purchases. Entire districts are devoted to stores, vendors, and malls, so make sure your credit card is ready to go. 

If you’re engaging in some sightseeing in Korea, you can’t go wrong with a dedicated visit to the many temples and palaces that dot the country. Many of these sacred locations are adorned with ponds, moats, and trees, allowing you to get back in touch with nature while you explore this nation’s vast history.

Stop by the museums and galleries of your choice to get a taste of the local modern culture. You’ll find fine art, eccentric modern pieces, and everything in between—and best of all, you can stop for delicious Korean food on just about any corner. 

What will you do in Korea?

►Subscribe to my videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
►Camera I use: http://amzn.to/2dEL3hv

On Day 21 of our Round The World Trip for food with Star Alliance, we spent the day in Barcelona. Barcelona is an amazing food city, and one of the best places to start eating is at La Boqueria. After eating and wandering, we headed over to Sagrada Família for a breathtaking tour. It was an amazing day of food and attractions in Barcelona.

00:34 Breakfast at Cotton House Hotel - We started off the morning at our hotel by having a quick breakfast. The jamon and selection of cured meats was the highlight.

2:53 Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria - Often known in short just as La Boqueria, this historical market is a food lover's paradise and a pilgrimage destination. We arrived early in the morning and headed first to Bar Pinotxo to eat our second breakfast. I ordered an omelet with eggplant and a plate of garbanzo beans and blood sausage. The dish was simple, but it was incredibly delicious. Additionally, the coffee was extremely good. Total price - 12.80 EUR ($14.04)

6:59 El Quim De La Boqueria - After finishing with the first place of tapas, I wandered over to another legendary tapas bar within La Boqueria market known as El Quim De La Boqueria. It’s a very expensive place, but I knew I wanted to try the fried eggs with baby squid. The dish was a simple combination of ingredients, but it was cooked perfectly, and it was incredibly delicious. I also couldn’t resist a plate of fried chilies. Total price - 32.05 EUR  ($35.16) There are dozens of things to eat and try at La Boqueria, and after all the salty food I was ready to have a passion fruit juice. And then finally, to conclude the Barcelona food tour of La Boqueria, I bought a cone of sliced Jamón Ibérico.

14:14 Gothic Quarter, Barcelona Cathedral - After an amazing food tour, we walked around the Christopher Columbus monument and then continued on walking around the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. The Barcelona Cathedral was originally closed when we arrived, but I came back in a few minutes and walked around the Barcelona Cathedral as well.

16:37 Xarcutería La Pineda - Located just around the corner from the Barcelona Cathedral, I headed over to a place called Xarcutería La Pineda (recommended by Chris English), to try the botifarra blanca and a cup of vermouth. It’s an amazing little family run shop with a fantastic array of meats and drinks. Total price - 11.50 EUR

21:25 Basílica de la Sagrada Família - One of the most famous attractions in Barcelona is the Sagrada Familia, a basilica that was famous designed by Antoni Gaudi. I had read and dreamed about visiting for many years, so I was very excited to finally have the chance to visit. What amazed me is how dark and gothic it looks from the outside, yet how light and happy it is on the inside. Sagrada Familia is truly a stunning architectural feat, and an attraction you must visit in Barcelona. Along with visiting the main part of Sagrada Familia, I also bought tickets to go to the Nativity Tower. Going to the top of the tower and walking down was the highlight of visiting. Price - 29.00 EUR per person w/ tower entrance

26:16 Catalan Food for dinner at Restaurant Portolés - For dinner Ying and I walked over to Restaurant Portolés, a local Catalan food restaurant. Some of the main dishes I ordered included Fideuà and Rollitos De Pollo, all of which were delicious. It’s a great restaurant to try in Barcelona. Total price - 26.50 EUR

This was a fantastic day in Barcelona, packed with delicious food and attractions in Barcelona.

318,-VZpk_Pvr-A,Expoza Travel,Bulgaria Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Bulgaria.
Bulgaria is located in the extreme south east of Europe, a country of natural splendour, fairy-tale like villages, ancient ruins, and monasteries with remarkable frescos as well as a culture that is between both Orient and Occident. Sofia, the ‘wise woman’ and, since 1879, capital of the new Bulgaria, a city whose roots date back to the fifth century B.C.  Once Thracians settled, then followed Romans, Goths, Huns and Ottomans.  At the end of the nineteenth century the city’s appearance changed from Oriental to European into a dynamic metropolis. Sofia’s historic city centre features the most splendid sacred building in the Balkan Peninsula, the Aleksandâr Nevski Cathedral, a work of art of the Russian Orthodox religion that can accommodate a congregation of more than five thousand. Vidin is dominated by the Baba Vida Fortress whose impressive towers and bastion date back to the thirteenth century.  From the banks of the Danube the north western entrances to the mediaeval realm were strictly controlled and the fortress protected it from invasion by ship. Varna is the biggest city on the Black Sea coast and is one of Europe’s oldest cities.  The golden, shining domes of the impressive cathedral in the city centre are one of its main landmarks. The caves of western Rhodopes are the main destination for many of the region’s visitors, such as the Jagodina Cave that is ten kilometres long and extends up to five levels within the limestone mountains.  It is the longest and deepest of the Rhodopes and its tunnels and huge galleries feature traces of prehistoric inhabitants. Bulgaria – on the border of both Occident and Orient - a country full of history and natural beauty with authentic culture and overwhelming hospitality.  A colourful mixture of fascinating tribes with a large variety of tradition and, according to legend, a part of paradise that God gifted to the Bulgarian people!

Uzbekistan is a country with thousands of years of history and contains all the magic of the Silk Road, as well as numerous oriental fairy tales, along with traditional culture, Islamic history and fascinating desert landscapes. Tashkent is the city of Amir Timur, the riding general who established a dynasty.  It is a city on the ancient Silk Road, famous in both orient and occident, and having inspired both scholars and poets, plus craftsmen and artists.  Modern Tashkent contains wide boulevards and plenty of lush greenery.  White storks that symbolize fertility crown the large entrance arcades to the Place Of Independence. Samarqand was the centre of one of the oldest forms of state in Middle Asia, and was located on the Silk Road.  Newly introduced Timurid style further enriched the architecture.  Coloured mosaics of astounding luminosity compete with glazed relief ceramics whose ornamentation is composed of arabesques, font characters and geometrical shapes.  Samarqand Bazaar now has a new, modern appearance and the variety of goods on offer has never been better with fresh fruit, vegetables, honey and cheese. The ‘Wild West’ of Uzbekistan is a wonderful region of deserts with just a few yurt camps for overnight accommodation.  Qirk Qiz Qala emerges from the middle of the flat, featureless desert.  Almost mystically, the final sharp fragments of the castle’s former defensive towers emerge from the ground which consist mainly of gravel and are covered with low saxaul bushes that defy the desert’s strong winds with their deep-reaching roots. The oasis city of Khiva is one of the greatest centres of ancient Korezm, ‘Land of the sun’, and was where mathematician Mohammed, who discovered algebra, once lived.  Almost fifteen hundred years of oriental culture are hidden within the intriguing winding streets of this fine oasis city. Uzbekistan has always been at the intersection of major trade and cultural routes and a border between Asia and Europe, between nomads and the Western world.  Exoticism mixed with all the magic of the One Thousand And One Nights!

Thanks for tuning in on another episode today. My destination is Pondicherry - often pegged as the French riveria of the east. But this time, as enamoured I was with its French inspired culture, food and architecture, I tried exploring more than that. 

On this trip, I want to invite you to a virtual trip with me, where we’ll explore  white town, the Pondy beach festival, some beautiful eateries, Auroville & it’s quaintness, some music therapy sessions, idyllic beaches and much more! 

The best part so far in the entire trip for me was the scuba diving! It My first dive ever and it was as phenomenal as it claims to be in every movie that shows it (talking about you, Zindagi na Milegi Dobara 😉) 

This vlog was also equally challenging as it was exquisite to shoot as it was in the peak of south India’s killing summer combined with the a long weekend which means tons and tons of people! 

Hope you enjoyed watching this as much as I enjoyed exploring. That’s all from me, until next time -

333,dkE1QX523PE,Expoza Travel,Latvia Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Latvia.
Latvia is a small Baltic republic, a country with a strong national identity, situated within the centre of the Baltic States.  Throughout the course of history its desire for freedom has always taken it forward. Riga is the capital of Latvia, a Hanseatic city and European capital of culture. Saint Petri Church is one of the oldest in the centre of the city and, at the same time, a main landmark.  It is one of the most important sacred buildings of the Middle Ages and is closely linked with the development of the city. Close to Riga is Jurmala, today a popular health resort on the Latvian Riviera, with splendid bay-windowed villas, battlements and towers, formerly Baroque and later with a nod at Gothic.  Thirty kilometres of beaches with bright erinaceous quartz and a mild climate created a holiday paradise in the nineteenth century. Amid the fertile Zemgale Plain is the magnificent, huge Baroque Jelgava Castle, the largest in Latvia.  In 1737 the residence of the then secular ruler of the Duchy Of Kurland was built on the ramparts of an ancient castle of the Livonian Order.  Beneath the southeast corner of the castle is the Crypt Of The Dukes, a tomb vault with thirty superbly decorated sarcophagi of tin and wood. The picturesque primordial river valley of Gauja has for centuries attracted travellers from each corner of the world.  This Livonian Switzerland not only has the charm of primary nature, but also all the ambience of the Middle Ages. Today’s Latvia is now striking a healthy balance between a market economy, ancient traditions and the burdensome legacy of a turbulent past.   Its journey into the European Union has been a success, thanks to courage, strength and faith!

335,_lcOX55Ef70,Tanya Khanijow,Solo in Paro Bhutan | Tiger's Nest visit | Bhutan Travel Guide | Bhutan Series Ep 1 | Tanya Khanijow,"Here’s presenting the first part of the Bhutan Series Episode in Paro. I went straight to Paro as first part of my road trip in the country. The drive from Phuntsholing took about 4 hours. 
 
The entire budget of my Bhutan trip was close to  INR 25k. You can carry cash everywhere in Indian currency in Bhutan as it is accepted. Some things about Paro below:

1. The place where I stayed at in Paro is called Ama’s Village Lodge. You can book the place here - https://www.booking.com/s/32_8/e9f2a7ab

2.  The cost of entry to Taktsang Goempa is INR 500 and a round trip with any driver will cost INR 1000 from your lodge

3. You can contact Mr. Yonten Norbu for driving you around Bhutan if you are visiting. His number is +975 17672515 , my experience with him was extremely nice. He was a perfect gentleman who ensured my safety and also made sure my experience in Bhutan was memorable.
 
4. If you are visiting Bhutan, I would highly advice you to get a local sim for contacting tour agencies or driver. A local sim will be available for INR 200 at Phuntsholing. 

5. Other places that you can visit in Paro are - Paro Dzong and you can get a Hot Stone bath which is very popular in the area

337,0Kqd6agnKVk,TourRadar,India Travel Guide: The Golden Triangle,"India is an irresistible country for travellers from all walks of life. From the incredible food to the ancient ruins to the unique and vibrant culture, India is an unforgettable destination for every kind of traveller. Whether you’re looking for a fast-paced adventure or a laid-back vacation, you’ll find it in India’s Golden Triangle. 

The Golden Triangle connects Delhi, the country’s capital; Agra, the regal home of the Taj Mahal; and Jaipur, also known as The Pink City. While the route itself isn’t very long, the sights visitors see will be treasured for a lifetime! After all, they don’t call it Golden for nothing! 

Beginning in Delhi, visitors will gape at Mughal-era architecture and history, from ancient forts to incredible monuments to high-tech skyscrapers and shopping centres. Take a ride on a rickshaw, feast on incredible food, and sip chai on a rooftop lounge. The possibilities are as endless as Delhi’s history!

Next, venture to Agra, the storied city home to India’s powerful nobility. One of the most famous buildings in the world, the Taj Mahal, can be found here, welcoming millions of visitors a year. Depending on the time of day you visit, you may discover it tinged pink with the rising sun, or beautiful gold under the moon. You can also stop at other incredible sites leftover from the Mughal empire, such as the Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri. 

Finally, end your trip to the Golden Triangle with a visit to Jaipur, or “The Pink City.” Here, you’ll find incredible buildings built with pink sandstone, giving the city an ethereal quality you won’t soon forget. Take a stroll through one of the many traditional shops, and find the perfect antique or handmade souvenir to bring home with you. 

A visit to India is always something special, but following the Golden Triangle route means you’ll truly be able to see this amazing country. Whether you’re planning your trip right now, or still in the daydreaming phase, why not head to TourRadar and check out a few Golden Triangle tours for yourself?

#Busan sits on the Korean Peninsula’s southern coastline, just a short flight from Asian capitals like Beijing and Tokyo.

Busan’s coastline offers scenery to match your every mood. Just a 40-minute subway ride from Busan Station is the city’s star attraction, Haeundae Beach. Seeking a little enlightenment? Make a wish at Haedong Yonggungsa Temple, one of the few temples in Korea built by the ocean. While Busan’s story has been shaped by the sea, it’s a city equally defined by its mountains. On Mt Cheonma, hike to the observation platform to see “Dynamic Busan” spread out before you. 

The colorful village of Gamcheon is symbolic of Busan’s new-found creative energy. The residents of Gamcheon transformed their neighborhood into one of the city’s top tourist #attractions. This creativity is echoed in Busan’s word-class museums, galleries and festivals. 

Welcome to Busan, a feast for all the senses, and the soul.

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Small and heavily populated, #Singapore is an easy place to #explore; nothing in the city is more than an hour from the business district. Thanks to modern construction and outstanding architecture, Singapore is rapidly becoming a powerhouse trade city, but it maintains ties to its Asian roots through traditional temples and many cultural hotspots. 

Your Singapore #tour must include the Botanical Gardens and Orchid Gardens, both beautiful and notable places to visit. If you’re a fan of exotic animals, stop by the Singapore Zoo and check in with its 300-plus species. You can also take a “bumboat” from Changi Beach to Pulau Ubin, set away from the bustling city, and delight in its quiet mangroves. 

No Singapore #vacation is complete without a visit to Marina Bay, a glowing, high-tech vision of the future, or Orchard Road, which boasts enough shopping to keep you occupied for several rainy afternoons.


For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Tokyo, a city of 30 million, is a place where traditions and modern inventions live together. From the Tokyo Tower one can see only skyscrapers, palaces made of concrete and glass, multi-level highway junctions and monorail expresses. But under the neon lights there are still rickshaw runners pulling their carts and geishas walking in their wooden shoes. The ornamented pagodas, the Japanese gardens, the calm Shintoist sanctuaries tell us about the age of shoguns and ninjas. The digital cameras and the swords of the samurais can be found at the same store. In the restaurants one can have sushi, sukiyaki and tempura sitting on a tatami, using chopsticks. We can take a look at the masterpieces of ikebana and origami and the pictures painted on rice paper. The travelers can take a trip to the ancient city of Kyoto, to the giant Buddha of Kamakura, to the warm springs and to the Sacred Mountain, Fujiyama, where the cherry trees are blossoming at the foot of the hills.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Welcome to Newfoundland! 

Newfoundland was our first province during the Road to 150, our 150-day road trip across Canada. We experienced icebergs, fjords, walking on the Earth's mantle, humpback whales, kitchen parties, and swimming in the Atlantic Ocean. But most of all, we fell in love with the people, which is a big part of what makes Newfoundland such a special place.

Canada's Road to 150 was a 150-day Canada-wide multimedia road trip celebrating Canada's 150th birthday by exploring the uniqueness of this country provincially and collectively while answering the question; What makes Canada special?

We drove to and through every driveable province and territory, showcasing Canada's natural beauty and regional attractions while interviewing Canadians of all cultures and backgrounds, including local celebrities, immigrants, refugees, and everyday rural and urban Canadians. Our aim was to dig deep into what makes Canada such an incredibly inspiring country while showing off the best of Canada's tourism to Canadians and to the world.

352,_AuXvnCLERA,Mark Wiens,The Ultimate Indonesian Food Day Trip - HUGE Nasi Liwet Feast!,"►Check out my list of 50 incredible Indonesian foods: https://migrationology.com/indonesian-food/
►Ken's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtMgyCDsju9EtUf2yBM0aZw

During my trip to Jakarta, I mostly remained in the city. But Ken and Gratiana from http://cowokrakus.com/ invited my wife Ying and I to go with them and their family on an Indonesian food trip to Bogor and the surrounding region (about an hour from Jakarta).

Our first stop when we drove out of Jakarta and to Bogor was a famous place to eat Bogor style laksa at a restaurant called Laksa Bogor Pak Inin. It was exactly my kind of a restaurant, open air and local, with a wonderful friendly environment. The laksa was unlike any other laksa I’ve ever had, and it was fantastic. Laksa Bogor - 10,000 IDR ($0.72)

Next, we stopped at a place called Toge Goreng Pak Abung, which is another legendary Indonesian food stop in Bogor, Indonesia, and they are famous for serving a bean sprout snack. It was definitely a very interesting dish, including a mixture of bean sprouts and fermented soy beans. Toge Goreng - 7,000 IDR ($0.51)

Next we drove into the beautiful Indonesian countryside and to the house. After having some Indonesian snacks and refreshing coconut, we then took a hike to go look for honey. The beekeeper was sick on the day we went, so we we’re able to get any honey, but it was still a beautiful hike.

The highlight of this Indonesian food trip for me was the Sundanese style Nasi Liwet Botram family feast that we had. All the food was laid out on banana leaves, and we all sat and ate some of the most beautiful and flavorful Indonesian food. It was an incredible culinary experience.

We drove back to Bogor and stopped at Warung Nasi Ampera to eat a quick dinner, and because I wanted to try some ikan pepes. The food was alright, but nothing compared to the lunch feast we had eaten! Total price - 103,000 IDR ($7.46) for 3 plates of food

Finally, back in Jakarta, we stopped near Manga Besar to have some desserts and to finish of this incredible day of Indonesian food. Sekoteng - 12,000 IDR ($0.87), Wedang Ronde - 12,000 IDR ($0.87)

It was an incredible Indonesian food trip to the outskirts of Bogor, and a nice opportunity to get out of Jakarta for the day.

A big thank you to Ken, Gratiana, and her family for inviting us to their house country house and for the amazing food.

354,km0dMUM39q0,Curly Tales ,3-Day Budget Trip To Mysore Under ₹7000 | The Solo Female Traveller EP 16 | Curly Tales,"Hello,
I traveled to Mysore for 3 days under ₹7k, beyond its palaces!

Mysore is known as the ""country of the royals,"" and home to India's second-most visited tourist destination -  Mysore City Palace. Mysore however has so much more than its palaces, and this trip was a revelation for that. 

From the untapped territories of the Sri Venugopalaswamy temple, to exploring the origins of Mysore Pak, to even experiencing my first solo kayaking at Varuna Lake. This trip has been an eye-opener for how much Mysore has to offer, and how much there is to unearth about this wonderful city.

Some must try things are the dosa at MTR, Sarsa Parila Juice at Brahmin Soda, Chamundi Hills and solo kayaking at Varuna Lake 

Best time to visit Mysore is definitely between October - March, however try visiting in its off-beat months to beat the crowd.

Thanks for tuning in again, and see you soon!

Until next time,
Neha Nambiar

Welcome to Cyprus! 

On this road trip across the south coast of Cyprus, I’m exploring Cyprus’ most amazing destinations. I’ve done the research, and chosen these must-do activities that will help you plan the perfect trip. Right! It’s time to share with you 9 of the most fantastic things to do on this beautiful island. 

The awesome power of nature is everywhere in Cyprus, and my first fantastic thing to do illustrates that perfectly - Avakas Gorge. Be sure to bring some comfortable shoes - there’s a short but lovely hike on the way to the gorge. 

Okay, so this is the Avakas Gorge trail that we're going to follow. It's very hot, it’s very dry, we’ve dosed up on sun cream, got tonnes of water in the bag and got about a 2-3km trek to go and find the Gorge. So yeah, let’s get walking!  

Like I said, it’s a popular tourist destination, so you can expect to see some tour groups on your walk. The tourist presence doesn’t ruin the appeal. A lot has been done to protect the area. It’s prohibited to pick any plants here, and animals roam freely. You’re completely surrounded by natural beauty.

The walk to the gorge sort of serves a double purpose. The blue sky, the lush green foliage - it sets you up for the shock of finally turning that corner and seeing the walls of the gorge. 

The gorge is 3km long, and the walls reach up to 30 metres high. These sheer rock walls are so tall that you’re completely protected from the sun, and the cool breeze blowing through the gorge is so nice after a warm and sticky hike. 

The river is low and calm under foot - but during the winter month, the river levels rise and the small stream becomes a torrent. This sense of danger isn’t just under foot- it’s also overhead.  

So there's a rock here which is wedged between the cliff faces and it looks pretty ominous! Looks like it’s about to drop. 

Beware that some of the mountain roads to get here can be quite tight and get busier as the day goes on. Something to note if you’re a nervous driver. 

So here’s a bonus tip for you - right next to wonderful thing to do number 3 is a fantastic restaurant called Oniro By The Sea. 

Fantastic food, refreshing cocktails, sea views - Oniro has everything, and I can’t recommend enough that you make it a stop on your trip and it’s just a stone’s throw away from our next destination. In fact, you can probably see it from your table. 



It’s just a 5 minute walk from the restaurant at most - the shipwreck of the Edro III. 

So that the Shipwreck behind me is quite a sight and it’s been here for just under 10 years now. So apparently back in 2011 it embarked for Rhodes, one of the Greek Islands. 

But never made it, because it hit a freak storm and ended up being caught up on the rocks here just off the coastline. 

So apparently people fled there, they made it safe, they took out the fuel as soon as they could, so that the oceans weren’t polluted and now? It makes for a rather nice photo opportunity as you can see down there. 

I couldn’t help myself - I had to get closer to the ship. The rocks are very rough in places, but I’m so glad I did - getting just that little bit closer to the shipwreck was so awe-inspiring. 

The clear water and crashing waves were hypnotising. But if you want even more bang for your buck, just 200 metres from the wreck are sea caves carved into the cliffs. 

A great opportunity to walk down the lunch, take some gorgeous holiday pictures, and get one last look at the shipwreck before heading to your next destination. 

Coral Bay Beach is widely regarded as one of the best beaches on the island. That’s right, it only took me three Things To Do until I wanted to hit the beach, and it’s the most visited beach on Cyprus’ West Coast. 

It’s easy to see why - it’s got fine, white sand, calm, clear water - everything you’d want for a day in the sun. If you’re put off by seeing so many people here, don’t worry. I found an easy solution. 

So yes, Coral Beach is a fairly obvious beach to come to, you’ve got your parasols your water sports, your deckchairs.","['holidayextras.com', 'holiday extras', 'cyprus', 'cyprus travel', 'cyprus travel guide', 'paphos', 'larnaca', 'ayia napa', 'paphos to larnaca', 'greek cyprus', 'cyprus holiday', 'cyprus 2020', 'cyprus island', 'cypriot travel guide', 'cyprus things to do', 'things to do cyprus', 'cyprus food', 'cyprus what to see', 'south cyprus', 'avakas gorge', 'coral bay', 'cyprus beach', 'kalidonia waterfall', 'cyprus 4k', 'explore cyprus', 'cyprus tr', 'cyprus holiday 2020', 'india guest']",2020-02-07T14:04:19Z,303450,2978,,385,PT14M44S,false

364,oDD6P5MgRQI,SOSAS AT SUNRISE,We Found The BEST Way To Travel Through Spain,"We found a better way to travel through Spain.  It's not the train, bus, or even flying.  Sometimes we make costly mistakes while traveling which pushes us to find alternatives from the norm.  We failed to buy train tickets from Madrid to Malaga early enough in advance and tickets were over 100 euro.  Flights were also expensive and a bus lacked any kind of excitement.  That's when we found BlaBlaCar.  BlaBlaCar is a ride sharing service that connects travelers heading in the same direction.  For us, it was a great way to possibly speak with a local and ultimately get to where we were going for a low price and in good time.  We enjoyed the ride and would look to BlaBlaCar again in the future.

From epic landscapes to monumental ruins, #Jordan allows us to reach out and touch the eternal and be at one with something far greater than ourselves.

The ancient Greeks knew Jordan’s capital, Amman, as Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. Overlooking Amman is the Citadel, the city’s ancient core. Rising over the Citadel are the remaining pillars of the Temple of Hercules, a Roman temple that in its day dwarfed many in Ancient Rome.  

From Amman, #journey north to Jerash, home to one of the largest concentrations of Roman ruins outside Italy. Then, continue north to Ajloun Castle, built to halt the Crusader armies as they rode down Jordan’s northern valley, hell-bent on Jerusalem.

Enter the gravel plains of the Eastern Desert and follow the Desert Castle Loop. For many, the highlight here is Qasr al-Azraq, where Lawrence of Arabia made his winter headquarters. 

Travel south to Madaba, famed for the Madaba Map, one of the earliest depictions of the Holy Lands. Continue south along the Kings Highway, which once took Arabs to Mecca, and Israelites to the Promised Land. 

Follow the hairpin road 1300 feet below sea level to the Dead Sea. Float in the saline waters and cover yourself in the same mineral-rich muds Cleopatra once enjoyed. 

No visit to Jordan is complete without a visit to Petra. Emerge from the shadows of the Siq and gaze up at the Treasury, the greatest of all of Petra’s 500 tombs. Then continue south to explore the emptiness of Wadi Rum. 

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Banff, located in Banff National Park in the Canadian Rockies, is one part resort town and one part breathtaking natural retreat.

Life is a little different at over 4,600 feet in elevation—by the way, that makes Banff Canada’s highest town. During your Banff sightseeing, you’ll learn that the town’s residents and visitors are a lively bunch, and you’ll find the local businesses are perfect for this festive crowd. Choose from over 100 restaurants to dine at, or stop by one or two of the dozens of pubs and cafes for an inexpensive snack and drink after walking through the many boutiques. You can also enjoy a marvelous time after the sun goes down; try dancing the night away at the Dancing Sasquatch, or visiting one of Banff’s other nightclubs. 

Banff National Park is known for its wildlife, some of which frequents Banff itself. You’ll often spot deer at the outskirts of town, some of which are friendly and curious about people. Once you say hello to the deer, make the drive to nearby Johnston Canyon, where you can take in snow-capped alpine scenery straight out of a fairy tale. 

Warm up after all this time spent outside: head to the Banff Upper Hot Springs. This exquisite spa has treated visitors to hot water and stunning views of the Rockies for over a century, and will continue to do so for a century to come.

What will you do on your Banff tour?

379,QyYZWNQl8n8,Samuel and Audrey - Travel and Food Videos,"Things to do in USHUAIA, Argentina 🇦🇷 | Ushuaia Travel Guide - the City at the End of the World! 🐧","Hello and greetings from Ushuaia, Argentina! Today we’re going to be visiting the southernmost city in the world, located in the province of Tierra del Fuego at the very bottom of Argentina.

This was the final stop of our massive trip across Patagonia, and in this video, we’ll be sharing some of the best things to do in Ushuaia during your visit. So join us as we cruise the Beagle Channel, ride the train to the end of the world, send a postcard from the southernmost post office, tour a former prison-turned museum, explore the city via double-decker bus, and a whole lot more!

The following is our Ushuaia travel guide and we hope this video gives you a few ideas of the many tours, attractions and experiences you can enjoy here!

🇦🇷 Things to do in Ushuaia, Argentina 🇦🇷

1) Cruise the Beagle Channel
This is a great opportunity to see some wildlife like cormorants, penguins and sea lions! Bring your passport on the cruise because you can get a Beagle Channel stamp. 

2) See the Lighthouse and End of the World
Often attributed as Jules Verne's lighthouse at the end of the world, this lighthouse's real name is Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse.

3) Admire the Penguins on Hammer Island
Not all tour operators are allowed to disembark at the penguin rookery, so in our case, we just admired them from the boat!

4) Go on a Double-Decker Bus Tour of Ushuaia
Picture an old-fashioned double-decker bus painted bright blue, and then get ready to be transported back through time as you set step aboard. Over the course of the tour you’ll get to learn about Ushuaia’s history and hear fun anecdotes, with a bit of tango music in between. 

5) Visit the Prison at the End of the World
Ushuaia was founded as a penal colony and this prison was in operation between 1902 to 1947. Today, it houses multiple museums including the Prison Museum, the Maritime Museum, the Antarctic Museum, the Art Museum, and the Art Gallery. 

6) Tour the Themed Gallery of Fuegian History
This is a museum featuring dioramas and lifelike figures that showcase the history of the province of Tierra del Fuego. The visit is done as a self-guided tour with an audio guide, so you can go at your own pace. 

7) Visit the End of the World Museum 
This museum deals with local history and natural history. The displays here focus on local wildlife and shipwreck remains. 

8) Visit the Former Government House + Botanical Garden
Set in the former Government House, this museum has a couple of displays relating to its history, as well as a small botanical garden.

9) Sample the Local Cuisine
Ushuaia has lots of unique seafood dishes and the thing to try is the king crab!

10) Go on a Walk along the Harbour
Another thing we’d recommend doing in Ushuaia is walking along the Costanera, which is the boardwalk along the waterfront. You can see all sorts of vessels in the harbour, including cruises departing for Antarctica.  

11) See the Saint Christopher
Once known as the HMS Justice, this was a Royal Navy ship classified as a rescue tug and it served at the Normandy landings during World War 2. After the war, the ship was sold and renamed Saint Christopher, where it was chartered for salvage operations in Beagle Channel. 

12) Take a photo at the Ushuaia City Sign
This is an iconic photo-op to show you made it to the end of the world.

13) Hike in Tierra del Fuego National Park
This is a very easy day trip from Ushuaia seeing as the park is located just 12 kilometres west of the city. This park consists of subantarctic forest and boasts some dramatic landscapes featuring snow-capped mountains, forests, lagoons and pebbly coves. One of our favourite hikes was Senda Costera, which is the coastal trail along the Beagle Channel.

14) Visit Lapataia Bay
This part of the national park features 6 mini trails that are between 400 meters and 2 kilometres in length. They are very short hikes and easy, so a great option if you are pressed for time. 

15) Send mail from the Southernmost Post Office
This tiny post office sits atop a pier on the shores of the Beagle Channel and it’s the last chance to send mail before reaching Antarctica. 

16) Ride the Train at the End of the World
Once upon a time, this was known as the train of prisoners, but today, the train has been developed into a heritage train and it’s considered the southernmost functioning railway in the world.

17) Take a Day trip to Tolhuin
This is a small town located an hour and a half away from Ushuaia. The main draw to this town is its famous bakery, where you can enjoy all sorts of pastries, empanadas, and even artisanal chocolates. Aside from that, there is a beautiful lake and a few hiking trails. 

And that concludes our Ushuaia travel guide! We hope you enjoyed getting to see the southernmost city in the world. As you can see, Ushuaia has plenty of unique attractions and fun excursions to offer visitors, so it’s well worth adding to your Argentina itinerary, especially if you’re planning to travel in Patagonia!","['ushuaia', 'ushuaia argentina', 'ushuaia argentina end of the world', 'ushuaia travel guide', 'visiting ushuaia', 'things to do in ushuaia', 'ushuaia things to do', 'best places to visit in ushuaia', 'what to do in ushuaia', 'what to see in ushuaia', 'what to visit in ushuaia', 'ushuaia argentina travel', 'ushuaia travel', 'ushuaia tourism', 'ushuaia travel vlog', 'travel ushuaia', 'ushuaia tour', 'ushuaia top attractions', 'ushuaia main attractions', 'ushuaia tours', 'ushuaia excursions', 'ushuaia southernmost city']",2021-09-04T15:00:12Z,124185,2330,,305,PT18M12S,true

Hit the waves in Huntington Beach, then head inland to explore the theme parks. The grandfather of all amusement parks is Disneyland®: it’s stood in Anaheim since 1965. Not far away is Knott’s Berry Farm®, once a collection of relocated ghost towns that evolved into a series of rides and amusements intended to celebrate the pioneer spirit. 

Despite its various architectural marvels, theme parks, and numerous activities, Orange County is famed for something much simpler: its sunsets. Head over to the nearest beach and watch the sun disappear into the Pacific.

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Transcript:

When anyone asks me about Vancouver I can honestly hand on my heart say, it’s one of the best places I have ever ever visited. 

Why?

Quite literally, the atmosphere. Vancouver’s clean air is thanks to it’s really close connection to nature. There are mountains and forests surrounding the City, and the Pacific ocean is right on the cities doorstep. Here the great outdoors isn’t just a place, it’s a way of life. But it’s a modern City waiting to be discovered as well. So in this guide, we’re going to help you make the most of it! We’re going to look at food, money, transport, and a whole lot more, but first let’s get from the airport. 

Vancouver International airport is less than 10 miles from Downtown area, and is Canada's second busiest airport, after Toronto Pearson International.

Getting between the airport and the City Centre is relatively straightforward – a 20-minute taxi ride will cost around $45. 

Another way into the City is the SkyTrain – it's a bit like London's DLR with driverless carriages, you take the Canada line for half an hour or so, and it costs around $7.

Vancouver has an extensive public transport network, as well as being a really easy place to dive. Here’s what you need to know:

Now it’s not often that we can tell someone to drive a car through a major City, but in Vancouver drive away until your heart's content! We hired a car and cannot recommend it enough. Thanks to the Cities grid system, wide roads with plenty of easy understood signs and generally well-tempered drivers - driving was an absolute doddle! There’s ample parking wherever you go, even at the busy tourist hotspots, not to mention fuel is cheap, and traffic generally wasn’t too bad in our experience.","['holidayextras.com', 'holiday extras', 'travel better', 'Canada', 'Canada Travel Guide', 'Vancouver', 'Vancouver Travel Guide', 'Travel Guide', 'British Columbia', 'Vancouver Tour', 'Vancouver Food', 'Vancouver Tips', 'Canada Travel', 'Vancouver Travel', 'Travel The world better', 'Tourist', 'Stanley Park', 'Lees Donuts', 'Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden', 'Gas Town', 'Capilano Suspension Bridge', 'Driving Abroad', 'Canadian Adventure', 'Road Trip', 'Canada Guide', 'Canadian Travel']",2017-10-30T10:41:27Z,1508915,16436,,1459,PT8M34S,true

America’s 50th state, Hawaii is a volcanic archipelago located in the heart of the Pacific Ocean. As it was the last state to join the US in 1959, the islands still retain much of their unique Hawaiian identity. Due to all the magnificent scenery, it’s worth spending as much time as possible outdoors, either hiking among the volcanoes, surfing the surrounding waves, or snorkeling above its colorful coral reefs. Here’s a look at the best places to visit in Hawaii:","['hawaii', 'hawaii tourism', 'hawaii travel', 'hawaii attractions', 'honolulu', 'oahu', 'Molokai', 'big island', 'Hapuna', 'Kaanapali', 'napali', 'Lanikai', 'Haleakala', 'Maui', 'Waimea', 'pearl harbor']",2021-09-02T13:00:01Z,613563,11070,,249,PT13M25S,true

Banff, located in Banff National Park in the Canadian Rockies, is one part resort town and one part breathtaking natural retreat.

Life is a little different at over 4,600 feet in elevation—by the way, that makes Banff Canada’s highest town. During your Banff sightseeing, you’ll learn that the town’s residents and visitors are a lively bunch, and you’ll find the local businesses are perfect for this festive crowd. Choose from over 100 restaurants to dine at, or stop by one or two of the dozens of pubs and cafes for an inexpensive snack and drink after walking through the many boutiques. You can also enjoy a marvelous time after the sun goes down; try dancing the night away at the Dancing Sasquatch, or visiting one of Banff’s other nightclubs. 

Banff National Park is known for its wildlife, some of which frequents Banff itself. You’ll often spot deer at the outskirts of town, some of which are friendly and curious about people. Once you say hello to the deer, make the drive to nearby Johnston Canyon, where you can take in snow-capped alpine scenery straight out of a fairy tale. 

Warm up after all this time spent outside: head to the Banff Upper Hot Springs. This exquisite spa has treated visitors to hot water and stunning views of the Rockies for over a century, and will continue to do so for a century to come.

What will you do on your Banff tour?

We cover activities you won't find in a typical Dubrovnik tourism brochure, Dubrovnik itinerary or Dubrovnik, Croatia city tour also known as Grad Dubrovnik Hrvatska.

20 Things to do in Dubrovnik, Italy Travel Guide Video Transcript: (Grad Dubrovnik Hrvatska): 

Is there a more visually stunning city than Dubrovnik? Nicknamed the Pearl of the Adriatic, this destination is sure to capture your gaze. Between it’s white limestone buildings, bright terracotta rooftops and cobalt blue waters that sparkle under the sunlight you'll be dazzled during your visit. This was the final stop of our travels in Croatia, and what a way to finish of our trip. 

We walked up, down, and around the Old Town clocking thousands of steps each day, and in this video we’re going to take you on a tour of of the city and show you 15 things to do in Dubrovnik.

We entered the Old Town through Ploće Gate, which is in the east end of the city strolling along the Old Port. We explored the Old Town on foot visiting Dubrovnik Cathedral, which at one point was even funded by England’s King Richard the Lionheart, after he was saved from a shipwreck on the nearby island of Lokrum. 

We wandered over to Gundulić Square where a few vendors had set up for the day to sniff out a few treats. We stopped at Big Onofrio Fountain, which was built in 1438 as part of a water system that supplied water from a spring 12km away.

Then, another attraction unexpectedly caught our attention: The Old Pharmacy at the Franciscan Monastery. 

Founded in the year 1317, this in-house pharmacy was set up by Franciscan friars and would go on to service the town as well as people living beyond the walls. There’s still a pharmacy within the monastery today.

We tried to visit the Rector’s Palace, which was built in the late 15th century for the elected rector who governed Dubrovnik, but it was under renovation.

A sightseeing boat tour called the “Panorama Excursion” departed from the Old Port and went out around Lokrum Island. 

We decided to eat at Mea Culpa, and ordered one Dalmatian Pizza and one Seafood Pizza. 

It was time for the main attraction: walking around Dubrovnik’s Old City walls. Admission is 150 kuna for a 2 kilometres walk that takes about 1 hour to complete.

The first set of walls were built in the 9th century, and then in the 14th century these were strengthened with forts along the circumference. This attraction is worth the price tag. From here you can admire the all of the old town, gaze at the shimmering waters of the Adriatic, and look out to the neighbouring Lokrum.

After that quick ice cream break, we walked over to Fort Lovrijenac, also known as St. Lawrence Fortress. 

Perched on a cliff 37 meters above the sea, this fortress dominates sea and land entrances from the western side of the city. 

We made a stop at Buza Bar, which is great place for drinks anytime of day, but especially so around sunset. Gradac Park, was also used as one of the Game of Thrones filming locations, so you may recognize it from the Purple Wedding.

That’s a wrap for Dubrovnik and the rest of our time in Croatia! We hope this video gave you ideas of some of the things you can do in Dubrovnik on your own visit.

This is part of our Travel in Croatia video series showcasing Croatian food, Croatian culture and Croatian cuisine.

#Explore rock pools at Mooloolaba Beach or learn more about the ocean at Sea Life - Underwater World. Wildlife experiences don’t come much more intense than the legendary Crocodile Hunter’s Australia Zoo.

When ready, browse vacation packages to Orange County: https://www.expedia.com/Orange-County.d603224.Destination-Travel-Guides

Your #OrangeCounty #vacation should include a #tour of some of the oldest Californian buildings in use today at Mission San Juan Capistrano. Don’t miss Laguna Beach, another town with a long history.  

At Crystal Cover, #stay in antique cabins put together from old Hollywood movie sets. At Newport Beach, sprawling, million-dollar homes line the harbor. 

Hit the waves in Huntington Beach, then head inland to explore the theme parks. The grandfather of all amusement parks is Disneyland®: it’s stood in Anaheim since 1965. Not far away is Knott’s Berry Farm®, once a collection of relocated ghost towns that evolved into a series of rides and amusements intended to celebrate the pioneer spirit. 

Despite its various architectural marvels, theme parks, and numerous activities, Orange County is famed for something much simpler: its sunsets. Head over to the nearest beach and watch the sun disappear into the Pacific.

 #MexicoCity welcomes visitors to its warm cultural heart. A #vacation here should feature the Centro Histórico district, where 1500 heritage buildings vie for your attention, including museums and galleries.
 
Head to Chapultepec Park, one of the largest urban parks in the world. Pay your respects to the Niños Heroes, a monument which honors the six boy soldiers who gave their lives defending Castillo de Chapultepec. Today, the castle serves as the National Museum of History. At Xochimilco, simply float away on a riot of color on the last of the city’s Aztec canals.
 
In the early 20th century the district’s artists, writers and intellectuals inspired not only Mexico, but the entire world. #Visit The Blue House, the birthplace of Frieda Kahlo, and the Museo Casa Estudio Diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo, where these two giants of Mexican art worked, lived and loved.  

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Transcript:

When anyone asks me about Vancouver I can honestly hand on my heart say, it’s one of the best places I have ever ever visited. 

Why?

Quite literally, the atmosphere. Vancouver’s clean air is thanks to it’s really close connection to nature. There are mountains and forests surrounding the City, and the Pacific ocean is right on the cities doorstep. Here the great outdoors isn’t just a place, it’s a way of life. But it’s a modern City waiting to be discovered as well. So in this guide, we’re going to help you make the most of it! We’re going to look at food, money, transport, and a whole lot more, but first let’s get from the airport. 

Vancouver International airport is less than 10 miles from Downtown area, and is Canada's second busiest airport, after Toronto Pearson International.

Getting between the airport and the City Centre is relatively straightforward – a 20-minute taxi ride will cost around $45. 

Another way into the City is the SkyTrain – it's a bit like London's DLR with driverless carriages, you take the Canada line for half an hour or so, and it costs around $7.

Vancouver has an extensive public transport network, as well as being a really easy place to dive. Here’s what you need to know:

Now it’s not often that we can tell someone to drive a car through a major City, but in Vancouver drive away until your heart's content! We hired a car and cannot recommend it enough. Thanks to the Cities grid system, wide roads with plenty of easy understood signs and generally well-tempered drivers - driving was an absolute doddle! There’s ample parking wherever you go, even at the busy tourist hotspots, not to mention fuel is cheap, and traffic generally wasn’t too bad in our experience.","['holidayextras.com', 'holiday extras', 'travel better', 'Canada', 'Canada Travel Guide', 'Vancouver', 'Vancouver Travel Guide', 'Travel Guide', 'British Columbia', 'Vancouver Tour', 'Vancouver Food', 'Vancouver Tips', 'Canada Travel', 'Vancouver Travel', 'Travel The world better', 'Tourist', 'Stanley Park', 'Lees Donuts', 'Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden', 'Gas Town', 'Capilano Suspension Bridge', 'Driving Abroad', 'Canadian Adventure', 'Road Trip', 'Canada Guide', 'Canadian Travel']",2017-10-30T10:41:27Z,1508915,16436,,1459,PT8M34S,true

When ready, browse vacation packages to Dublin: https://www.expedia.com/Dublin.d178256.Destination-Travel-Guides

Despite a long and sometimes tragic history of invasion and resistance, this thriving business capital has poetry, music and literature percolating through its cobblestones.

While #Dublin proudly honours its past, it is equally passionate about enjoying each and every new day. Nowhere is life celebrated more than in the city’s nearly 700 pubs. 

Of all the gifts, Dublin has given to the world, perhaps the most intoxicating are its stories. Originally built for the sons of the Irish gentry, the ivy-covered stone buildings of Trinity College are home to some of the oldest remaining manuscripts in the world, including the 1000-year-old Book of Kells.

Dubliner Jonathan Swift, once said, “May you live all the days of your life.” There is no better way to define Dublin. Its passion for life is contagious, captivating and sure to stay with you after your #vacation here for the rest of your days.

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Travel video about destination Myanmar.
Myanmar is a land of golden pagodas in which rivers, paddy fields and Buddhism dominate the lives of this country’s people who are made up of a variety of ethnic groups. But behind the bamboo curtain is a sleepy fairy tale land.Yangon is a river city and the capital of Myanmar. It is surrounded by India, China, Laos and Thailand. Few cities in Asia boast such a fascinating mêlée of tribes and cultures. A tranquil harmony of churches, pagodas, Hindu temples and mosques. The Chaukhtatkyi Pagoda contains one of the largest prone Buddha statues in the world. Its length makes up for its lack of artistry as it is seventy metres long! The Shan State Express is a sonorous name for a unique train that travels to the north of Myanmar and to the legendary kingdom of the Shan. The railroad travels in a zigzag up the mountains which enables it to negotiate severe slopes that would otherwise be impossible for it to climb vertically. It provides a fascinating insight into the culture and everyday life of the Shan people. The city of Pyin U Lwin, that is also known as Meymo, was once a British military base. Even today the city still has a certain air of nostalgia and passengers are offered various refreshments as the train journey normally takes more than twelve hours. Ox carts transport visitors to one of the most interesting buildings in Mingun, the Mingun Pagoda. It was designed to be the world’s largest pagoda. Huge numbers of workers built this seventy two metre wide and fifty metre high building. Bagan is the country’s ancient capital city. Prior to visiting the largest area of Buddhist ruins in the world visitors can enjoy both traditional puppet shows and dance. Classical myth and legend make up this theatrical treat of which each puppeteer is responsible for up to sixty strings. Any journey through Myanmar is a journey into the past and to a hidden world of dreams and mystique. This gateway to paradise is slowly opening up and revealing a splendid land of bygone times!

The town of Bacalar in Quintana Roo, sits at the very southeastern tip of Mexico, and its position along the absolutely stunning Bacalar Lagoon makes this place worth the offbeat journey; come on let me show you why. Here are the best things to do in Bacalar, Mexico in one day!

Cenote Azul - Cenote Azul is one of the deepest cenotes in all of the Riviera Maya, at some 90 Meters or 290 feet deep and this beautiful dark blue pool presses right up against the ridiculously tropical turquoise waters of the lagoon, which we’ll jump into next.

Fort San Felipe - Spanish Conquistadors successfully took Bacalar in 1543, but that didn’t stop pirates from raiding and terrorizing this paradise all throughout the 1600’s. They could easily enter up through a canal in the lagoon, so this fort was incredibly important to protect the city from, well, yet another intruder. 

Bacalar Lagoon Boat Tour - Now, I promise this isn’t just another boat trip scene, this insanely gorgeous, freshwater lagoon is known as Lake of Seven Colors, as the variety of blue and turquoise hues make this place so unique. A White sandy bottom, cloud coverage and water depth causes colors to morph into varying shades of gatorade like mother nature’s own tie-dye. And we find one incredible inlet sandbar to drop anchor and join the party. This is most definitely the best thing to do in Bacalar!

Best Places to Eat in Bacalar - Then, the only thing that can pull me away from this perfect scene, it’s time to head back on shore, for lunch at Kai Pez in downtown Bacalar, right next to Bacalar Lagoon.

Los Rapidos - Alright, there’s just one more place I want to show you for the day, if you promise to be cool about it. A turquoise-colored natural lazy river in the middle of nowhere! Now, If you come here based on this video, please make me proud and don’t touch the side walls of this river. 

This is a very sensitive habitat, made beautiful by one lagoon runoff and those same estromatolitos (Stromatolite) we spoke about early. All of the white exterior are living microorganisms that will die if disrupted, just like coral. The trick is, get in and out and designated locations and just let yourself float down stream. It’s amazing.

We stayed at the beautiful Mia Bacalar, right on Bacalar Lagoon. I highly recommend this resort in Bacalar!

466,Vb7NGZQEdTI,Expoza Travel,Nepal Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Nepal.
At the foot of the huge peaks of the Himalayas is Pokhara and it is from here that we begin our journey through Nepal. In the past, Pokhara was an important trading link between India and Tibet but the trading of salt and wool came to an end after Tibet closed its doors to the outside world.Kathmandu is a melting pot of both race and religion, a metropolis in the heart of the Kingdom of Nepal, a country of snow-covered mountains inhabited by the gods. Kumari Chowk is the residence of the living goddess, Kumari, who is duly selected from childhood. She is not allowed to leave until puberty as her task is it affirm the king his power. Traditional ceremonies are celebrated throughout the year such as the Festival Of The Children that is a symbol of fertility and sexual purity. Patan is Nepal’s second largest city and has retained much of its original character due to its three hundred monasteries and temples. It is also one of the oldest settlements in Kathmandu Valley and during the 15th century was the capital of one of three kingdoms. Bhaktapur is the third ancient regal city of the thirty kilometre long Kathmandu Valley that has always been a prosperous trading route between China, Tibet and India. Through the golden gate of Sundhoka is the old royal palace complex. The Torana above the gate is richly gilded and features the ten-armed goddess, Taleju, and her loyal guards. Located on a 1,400 metre high hill, Swayanbunath is a Buddhist monastery complex and one of the most interesting sights in Nepal. The country’s oldest stupa dates back to the 5th century and is entered from an easterly direction up a staircase that contains three hundred and sixty-five steps. Endless rows of prayer mills and religious images are the instruments of the people’s deep faith. Hidden in a canyon and located on top of a mountain creek, Dakshinkali stands guard over the valley. This wonderful place is dedicated to the bloody goddess, Kali. The customs of the people in the ‘Kingdom On The Roof Of The World’ may seem somewhat strange. But this land of jungle and eternal snow has developed according to its own rich traditions and beliefs. Like magic!

Welcome to Saskatchewan!

Often known as an incredibly flat province, nothing could be further from the truth. With lush boreal forests and pristine lakes in the North to prairie landscapes and badlands in the South, Saskatchewan is the perfect place for outdoor lovers to explore.

We drove a pontoon boat around Lake Waskesiu, learned about the province's first nations at Wanuskewin Heritage Centre, and went for a float in Canada's version of the dead sea. We also toured the RCMP Heritage Centre, witnessed the RCMP sunset ceremony, climbed a massive sand dune, and hiked through one of the few remaining natural grasslands in North America. We packed a lot of adventures into our short visit and can't wait to return one day and explore the province further.

We explored Saskatchewan from July 27th - August 8th, 2017!

Finally, one of the long awaited flyovers in the city, the four-lane bi-directional flyover from Shilpa Layout to the Outer Ring Road near Gachibowli Junction, is all set for inauguration.

Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials said around 95 per cent of work on the flyover, which has taken quite some time in the making, were completed and the remaining part too would be completed by November.
“Some works could not be completed due to the intense spells of rains recently. As we are expecting intense spells of rains during September, we are hoping to complete the remaining work by November,” a GHMC official said, adding that around five spans were yet to be laid besides some final touch-up works.

The Shilpa Layout flyover is 823 metres in length and 16.60 metres wide. Once open to traffic, the flyover will ensure free flow of traffic from Shilpa Layout to the ORR. On the Shilpa Layout road, peak hour traffic in 2020 was 1,464 passenger car units (PCU) per hour and the projected peak hour traffic in 2040 is 5,194 PCU per hour.

The flyover has already been termed an engineering feat by the GHMC, with some spans of the flyover being installed 18 metres above the ground and placed across the existing Gachibowli Crossroad Flyover.

In addition to this facility, simultaneously, construction of another six-lane bidirectional flyover towards Kondapur is underway. Presently, the foundations of this project are under construction and the flyover will be 816 metres long and 24 metres wide.

“The probable date of completion of this six-lane bidirectional flyover is December 2023,” a GHMC official said.

The estimated contract value of both projects is Rs.313.52 crore and both these projects are being built under the State government’s flagship Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP).

Both these flyovers have a series of benefits to offer after they are made available to the public. Traffic at the busy Gachibowli Junction will be decongested to a great extent. They will also ensure better connectivity between HITEC City and the Financial District besides easing traffic heading towards Meenakshi Group Buildings.","['shilpa layout flyover', 'shilpa layout flyover at gachibowli', 'shilpa layout flyover opening date', 'shilpa layout hmt colony', 'shilpa layout shankarpally', 'shilpa layout tellapur', 'shilpa layout orr flyover', 'shilpa layout flyover plan', 'hyderabad shilpa layout flyover', 'hyderabad shilpa layout', 'hyderabad developments', 'shilpa layout to gachibowli flyover', 'shilpa layout', 'shilpa layout gachibowli', 'flyovers in hyderabad', 'hyderabad flyover construction', 'hyderabad flyovers']",2022-11-23T10:30:03Z,15582,611,,78,PT5M17S,false

New Zealand boasts a temperate climate with plenty of sunshine and moderate rainfall. Because of the long coast line, you can expect mild temperatures for the most part. The average temperature decreases as you travel south; January and February are the warmest months with July being the coldest month of the year. Remember to pack your waterproof hiking boots, waterproof rain jacket, swimsuit, flip flops, thin gloves, hiking socks, sunglasses, and a camera with extra batteries. 

New Zealand's currency is the New Zealand Dollar (NZ$). You should expect to be able to switch between cash and cards quite seamlessly, as all major credit cards can be used in New Zealand. Alcohol and restaurant meals can range from moderate to quite expensive so prepare yourself accordingly.

We'd like to thank New Zealand's incredible tourism board for allowing use of their travel footage: http://www.newzealand.com/

Although it is physically separated from the rest of the United States, Alaska is one of the most scenic and fascinating parts of the country. Its seclusion only adds to the beauty and mystery of the 49th state, making it an appealing getaway spot for intrepid travelers and nature lovers.  Along with the major cities like Anchorage, it is important to get out and experience the natural wonders and attractions that make Alaska so beloved. Here’s a look at the best places to visit in Alaska.","['alaska', 'alaska travel', 'alaska tourism', 'denali', 'Ketchikan', 'glacier bay', 'Anchorage', 'home', 'Skagway', 'Mendenhall Glacier', 'Kenai Fjords', 'katmai']",2022-04-04T13:00:21Z,215410,3577,,133,PT13M15S,false
474,9KjEF8NYNuc,Expoza Travel,Zagreb (Croatia) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Zagreb is the political and cultural heart of Croatia, an amiable capital city located at the intersection of Central, Eastern and Southern Europe and a city that holds many memories of the Danube Monarchy. Zagreb originated in the Middle Ages from two rival settlements on neighbouring hills, the bishop's seat of Kaptol which is dominated by its cathedral and the free city of Gradec which was its political centre.  They both formed the city’s Upper Town. The cathedral dominates the Kaptol district, its two steeples towering above the old city. The city’s marvellous Botanical Garden contains an array of wonderful natural sights.  It boasts ten thousand tree and plant varieties including alpine, Mediterranean, and the exotic.  Small ponds with water plants are also included in the four point seven hectare gardens. An imposing arcaded facade forms the entrance to the Mirogoj Cemetery which is laid out as a park and is an artistic masterpiece.  Here, leading sculptors built tombs for the country’s most famous personalities from the arts, culture and politics, including the grave of Franjo Tudjman. A narrow mountain road leads up to the Medvednica Nature Park, outside the city gates.  The mediaeval Medvedgrad Fortress is a most striking and interesting attraction located in twenty three thousand hectares of natural landscape. Zagreb is a special city, unique, with a never-ending story, a city that has witnessed a thousand years and, due to its historic values, has become a European Capital Of Culture.

When ready, browse vacation packages to Yosemite National Park: https://www.expedia.com/Yosemite-National-Park.d180672.Destination-Travel-Guides


#YosemiteNationalPark sits on the western slopes of California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains. Most visitors spend their #vacation in Yosemite Valley, which despite being only 7 miles long and 1 mile wide, packs in more jaw-dropping scenery than just about any other place on Earth. 
 
#Visit Tunnel View and stand before a panorama that’s reduced generations of visitors to silence. The Yosemite Valley ring road follows the banks of the Merced River, which shifts in character as it thunders from the valley walls, before gently winding across the valley floor. The ring road is dotted with trailheads that lead to 800 miles of hiking trails. 

Drive along Tioga Road, one of the USA’s most scenic highways. Fill your lungs with alpine air at Olmsted Point, refresh yourself by the waters of Tenaya Lake, then spend the day at Tuolumne Meadow, the traditional summer hunting grounds of the Ahwaneechee.
 

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

When European explorers first ventured into these enchanting lands, they returned with stories which most people dismissed as hallucinations.

486,9LM4_vZoqG8,Washington Post,Neck pillow review: Which one is best for travel?,"The neck pillow is not the travel world’s most popular piece of gear. Some people swear by them to help make the best out of a bad sleep situation; most think they’re useless but schlep them around airports anyway. But this accessory has come a long way since the most infamous inflatable options hit the market. Today, online retailers have pages and pages of options so you can buy one well before your flight. But which models are worth your time and money? We tested three, plus a bonus, to guide you through your travel-neck-pillow shopping process. The contenders include the Easy Breather by Nest Bedding ($59.99), the Cabeau Evolution Classic ($29.99), the Trtl ($29.99) and a cervical collar, or neck brace (between $10-$20 at most drugstores). See which pillow — or medical device — is most popular in our video.

Located on the Balkan Peninsula, Romania is a country of contrasts. The former Soviet Bloc country has, over the years, belonged to the Romans who gave the country its name, the Hungarians and the Ottomans. It is filled with quaint old towns, mountain resorts that offer great skiing, and a burgeoning art community. It’s most famous citizen, however, may be the vampire Dracula, a fictional character found in Transylvania.

Cold Spring Tavern (5995 Stagecoach Rd, Santa Barbara, CA 93105, United States) - One of the greatest legendary and historical destinations in California for BBQ tri tip is Cold Spring Tavern, it’s a hidden gem. You can choose to sit down without the tavern or forest, and they serve up tri-tip sandwiches in a huge way. They are delicious especially when paired with all their signature sauces. Their onion rings are also fantastic. Price - $13 per sandwich

Jocko's - Steakhouse (125 N Thompson Ave, Nipomo, CA 93444, United States) - Next up on this California BBQ meat tour we drop to Nipomo, and to one of the most legendary steakhouses in the United States - Jocko’s. Jeffrey had been telling me about their double cut XXL spencer steak grilled over red oak. It’s every bit as amazing and more than it sounds. One of the best steaks ever.

Da Hickory House BBQ (2790 Seaglass Way, Oxnard, CA 93036, United States) - Finally to wrap up this food tour we drove over to Oxnard and Raquel took us to Da Hickory House BBQ for a leg sized tri-tip sandwich!

491,LFuNMxU3cDM,BackPacker Steve,10 Best Travel Channels on YouTube to follow & travel virtually (my personal favorites),"Exploring foreign countries with their diverse nature and culture isn’t always possible. In this video I want to share a list of my 10 favorite travel channels on YouTube with you!

Exploring foreign countries with their diverse nature and culture isn’t always possible - for different reasons. During those times I love watching travel videos - to prepare for an upcoming trip, to get inspired or to simply travel virtually to places far away. 

Over the past few years I started following different travel related channels on Youtube and even got the chance to work together with some fellow content creators on some of my own trips. While some channels stopped producing content or decided to head into a different direction over time, others stood out and kept inspiring me with their quality content on a regular base.

I came up with this list of the 10 best travel travel channels on Youtube to follow.

Following you can find all of the channels I featured in this video:

When you’re ready to enjoy the most stunning eight minutes of your life, climb aboard the Banff Gondola to take in the gorgeous alpine landscape of Alberta.

The Canadian Rockies are among the most beautiful mountains in the world. In summer, these mountains are exquisite alpine peaks, capped in green trees and towering over lush valleys. In winter, these mountains are arguably even more beautiful—snow-capped precipices that stretch on as far as the eye can see. 

You can get an up-close look at this beauty when sightseeing on the Banff Gondola. From the town of Banff, you’ll head to Sulphur Mountain, located just a few miles away. Climb into the glass-enclosed gondola with a handful of other passengers. When the Banff Gondola tour begins, your gondola will ascend the mountain range at a measured pace, giving you plenty of time to see Banff itself, the Bow Valley, and the mountain ranges that comprise the Canadian Rockies. 

The Banff Gondola stops at a staggering height of 7,500 feet, allowing you an astonishing view of the world below. Bring your camera to snap some pictures, because you’ll never want to forget the stunning vistas that you see. If you elect to stay on top of the mountain for a bit, you can learn about the history of the region on a one-mile interpretive walk. Alternatively, you can enjoy a meal and refreshments at the nearby restaurant while looking out over one of nature’s most precious accomplishments.

What were your impressions when you took the Banff Gondola ride?

Starting in the popular tourist spot Cancún on the Yucatán Peninsula, they take the 2.5-hour drive to visit the Mayan ruins and ancient structures. The highlight is the Temple of Kukulcán (El Castillo), a 24-meter-high pyramid. 

As impressive as the Mayan architecture is, learning about some of the brutal rituals they practiced is not for the faint hearted.Chichen Itza is a UNESCO World Heritage Site as well as one of the most visited archeological sites in Mexico. Dhruv’s tip: Pay the entrance fee in cash – it’s cheaper than with credit card.Dhruv and Juli also visit the nearby Cenotes, water-filled limestone sinkholes. Of course, Dhruv can’t resist jumping into one of them.

When ready, browse vacation packages to Vancouver: https://www.expedia.com/Vancouver.d178315.Destination-Travel-Guides

#Explore the early history of #Vancouver at Waterfront Station, the western terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway. On your #vacation, experience the interweaving of cultures in Chinatown, where the fusing of Oriental flavors with local seafood has helped earn the city the title, “the Culinary Capital of Canada.”
 
After visiting Vancouver’s central highlights, ride the ferry to Granville Island. From Granville Island, head to Queen Elizabeth Park on Little Mountain, a peaceful oasis high above the city.
 
When it’s time to answer the call of the wild, cross the Lions Gate Bridge to The North Shore, a wilderness where bears roam and salmon-filled rivers flow through old-growth forests.  

Less than a two-hour drive from the city is Whistler Blackcomb Resort, the largest ski resort in North America. The beautifully connected runs here cater to all skill levels and attract elite skiers and beginners from all over the globe.

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Gorgeous beaches, verdant mountains and postcard-perfect historic towns draw an increasing number of visitors every year.

Sri Lanka may be a small island in the Indian Ocean but that’s the only thing small about it. The country, formerly known as Ceylon, boasts an ancient civilization, golden sandy beaches with their swaying coconut palms, mountains, and tea plantations. While visiting the island, you’ll see colonial architecture from the days when the Portuguese, Dutch and English ruled. You’ll also see lots of elephants, some of which participate in local festivals and, if you’re lucky, perhaps a leopard or two at a wildlife sanctuary.

503,9LM4_vZoqG8,Washington Post,Neck pillow review: Which one is best for travel?,"The neck pillow is not the travel world’s most popular piece of gear. Some people swear by them to help make the best out of a bad sleep situation; most think they’re useless but schlep them around airports anyway. But this accessory has come a long way since the most infamous inflatable options hit the market. Today, online retailers have pages and pages of options so you can buy one well before your flight. But which models are worth your time and money? We tested three, plus a bonus, to guide you through your travel-neck-pillow shopping process. The contenders include the Easy Breather by Nest Bedding ($59.99), the Cabeau Evolution Classic ($29.99), the Trtl ($29.99) and a cervical collar, or neck brace (between $10-$20 at most drugstores). See which pillow — or medical device — is most popular in our video.

The views were absolutely incredible and luckily the weather was perfect, no wing & no rain :)
First we stopped at Silver Strand Beach and then hiked on Europe's highest sea cliffs, the Slieve League Cliffs (Sliabh Liag) and the views were just jaw dropping.
Later on we went to the town of Donegal and enjoyed a big pizza for dinner.

Be sure to add this incredible destination to your travel bucket list :)

Cold Spring Tavern (5995 Stagecoach Rd, Santa Barbara, CA 93105, United States) - One of the greatest legendary and historical destinations in California for BBQ tri tip is Cold Spring Tavern, it’s a hidden gem. You can choose to sit down without the tavern or forest, and they serve up tri-tip sandwiches in a huge way. They are delicious especially when paired with all their signature sauces. Their onion rings are also fantastic. Price - $13 per sandwich

Jocko's - Steakhouse (125 N Thompson Ave, Nipomo, CA 93444, United States) - Next up on this California BBQ meat tour we drop to Nipomo, and to one of the most legendary steakhouses in the United States - Jocko’s. Jeffrey had been telling me about their double cut XXL spencer steak grilled over red oak. It’s every bit as amazing and more than it sounds. One of the best steaks ever.

Da Hickory House BBQ (2790 Seaglass Way, Oxnard, CA 93036, United States) - Finally to wrap up this food tour we drove over to Oxnard and Raquel took us to Da Hickory House BBQ for a leg sized tri-tip sandwich!

Finally, one of the long awaited flyovers in the city, the four-lane bi-directional flyover from Shilpa Layout to the Outer Ring Road near Gachibowli Junction, is all set for inauguration.

Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials said around 95 per cent of work on the flyover, which has taken quite some time in the making, were completed and the remaining part too would be completed by November.
“Some works could not be completed due to the intense spells of rains recently. As we are expecting intense spells of rains during September, we are hoping to complete the remaining work by November,” a GHMC official said, adding that around five spans were yet to be laid besides some final touch-up works.

The Shilpa Layout flyover is 823 metres in length and 16.60 metres wide. Once open to traffic, the flyover will ensure free flow of traffic from Shilpa Layout to the ORR. On the Shilpa Layout road, peak hour traffic in 2020 was 1,464 passenger car units (PCU) per hour and the projected peak hour traffic in 2040 is 5,194 PCU per hour.

The flyover has already been termed an engineering feat by the GHMC, with some spans of the flyover being installed 18 metres above the ground and placed across the existing Gachibowli Crossroad Flyover.

In addition to this facility, simultaneously, construction of another six-lane bidirectional flyover towards Kondapur is underway. Presently, the foundations of this project are under construction and the flyover will be 816 metres long and 24 metres wide.

“The probable date of completion of this six-lane bidirectional flyover is December 2023,” a GHMC official said.

The estimated contract value of both projects is Rs.313.52 crore and both these projects are being built under the State government’s flagship Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP).

Both these flyovers have a series of benefits to offer after they are made available to the public. Traffic at the busy Gachibowli Junction will be decongested to a great extent. They will also ensure better connectivity between HITEC City and the Financial District besides easing traffic heading towards Meenakshi Group Buildings.","['shilpa layout flyover', 'shilpa layout flyover at gachibowli', 'shilpa layout flyover opening date', 'shilpa layout hmt colony', 'shilpa layout shankarpally', 'shilpa layout tellapur', 'shilpa layout orr flyover', 'shilpa layout flyover plan', 'hyderabad shilpa layout flyover', 'hyderabad shilpa layout', 'hyderabad developments', 'shilpa layout to gachibowli flyover', 'shilpa layout', 'shilpa layout gachibowli', 'flyovers in hyderabad', 'hyderabad flyover construction', 'hyderabad flyovers']",2022-11-23T10:30:03Z,15582,611,,78,PT5M17S,false

We might be for you. We encourage individuality and flexibility. We didn't invent the moon but we certainly used the wheel. What you spin is where you land, we're there already, waiting, with two beers. One for me, one for you. Make it four beers.

Travel, artistically, culturally, interactively, theatrically.

We're traditional festival travel but we also make our own fun. We're the cardboard box of the new toy you just got. They didn't advertise it but you know can do so much more with it, and it's worth a lot later on in life.

526,rsv4drcgHys,touropia,10 Best Places to Visit in Egypt - Travel Video,"Check out all the places seen in this video: https://www.touropia.com/best-places-to-visit-in-egypt/

With a fascinating history that reaches back to the dawn of civilization, Egypt is considered the oldest travel destination on earth. The African nation’s awe-inspiring temples and pyramids have captured the imagination of travelers for thousands of years. Although most people come to Egypt to view its ancient monuments, natural attractions beckon travelers too. The Red Sea coast is known for its coral reefs and beach resorts while a trek through the Sahara can lead visitors to a refreshing oasis. Here’s a look at the best places to visit in Egypt:","['giza', 'egyptian pyramids', 'giza pyramids', 'cairo', 'luxor egpyt', 'aswan', 'best places to visit in egypt', 'egypt travel', 'egypt tourism', 'egypt attractions', 'places in egypt', 'Hurghada', 'alexandria egypt', 'mount sinai', 'Sharm el-Sheikh', 'siwa oasis', 'Dahshur']",2019-05-07T12:24:47Z,1439975,15169,,951,PT13M26S,true

It seems really strange for an aviation and travel lover like myself to say this, but I've decided to stop traveling this month due to the pandemic. In this video, I reveal some of the current pain points related to flying and travel.

With so many flights canceled, so many countries on the red list, so many PCR tests requirements, and so many apps to download. There’s just so much work before you fly internationally. It begs the question will travel ever be the same again? 

In the video, I invited 3 experts to talk about how flying will change in 2022. Is there a new normal developing? How can we have a smoother and more consistent travel experience? What’s the outlook of the commercial aviation industry in 2022?

This video shows me traveling for three weeks in Colombia. Traveling Colombia by yourself is a great idea. See the proof above. 
A journey to Colombia is absolutely recommended. So, don’t hesitate if you are in a doubt about going to Colombia. 
I hope this travel video about Colombia inspires you to pack your bags and explore it. Travel Colombia it is.
As you can see, I visited many places in Colombia. My favorite places were Medellin, Salento, Guatape and Minca. Also Bogota is surprisingly good. And please don't forget the hike in Valle de Cocora.
Next to these places, don’t forget to visit Cartagena, Palomino, Santa Marta and

Reizen in Colombia. Je ziet hier mijn reis door Colombia in slechts drie weken. Drie weken alleen reizen in Colombia is een prima tijd om de mooiste delen van Colombia te kunnen zien. Reizen door Colombia is daarnaast helemaal niet onveilig. Met meerdere personen of lekker alleen reizen in Colombia. Kan allemaal.
Een reis door Colombia maken?  In je eentje of met meerdere mensen? Twijfel niet, maar pak je spullen en boek een ticket bij meneer vliegmaatschappij! 

Ga naar de grote steden Medellin en Bogota. Vergeet daarnaast niet de prachtige stadjes en dorpjes: Salento, Guatape, Cartagena, Santa Marta, Palomino en Minca. 
Deze reisvideo van Colombia laat de mooiste plekken zien. Reizen door Colombia is daarnaast niet gevaarlijk. Velen mensen denken van wel, maar dat is allang niet meer zo. 
Sterker nog, dit is een land waar ik nog nooit zulke vriendelijke mensen heb ontmoet.

North Sikkim is one of the places to visit in Sikkim
Clouds, waterfalls, calm place and so much more during this journey, we also enjoyed amazing brunch at one of the food joints.

If you want to support this channel, please visit: https://www.patreon.com/visa2explore

Details of places visited by us is given below:

Distance between Gangtok to Lachen North Sikkim 135 Km

1.Naamsingh WaterFall 

2. Seven Sisters Waterfall
Samosa ₹10 & Tea ₹10 nearby to this Waterfall

3. We bought some Vegetables from Local Vegetable Shop for our onward journey, as advised by our Driver, you will not get these in Lachen. If you want to have Traditional food you can bought some Vegetables.

4. Country BA & Restaurant: They are really good on traditional food. Every food we had at this place was lifetime experience.

If you enjoy traditional food then this is a great place...

Fooding & Lodging
Address - Tingchim Zero, North Sikkim, 
Opp. IInd Last Petrol Pump of North Sikkim
Traditional Meal - ₹ 250

Contact number - 9002774881, 9647853099, 

There is no telecom network at this place so these numbers may not be of much help.. 

5.  Singhik View Point, Mangan

You will get to see beautiful scenic view from this point.
We went there in Monsoon weather we could not see the Mt. Kanchenjunga, otherwise from this point, Mount kanchenjunga can be seen clearly.

We did this journey through a local travel agency, its name is Tamu travels… Lalit is the owner:

Tamu Tour and travels
Development area, Gangtok east Sikkim.
http://www.tamutourandtreks.com/

9832564013
9002069916.

This journey from Gangtok to North Sikkim then west and south Sikkim for us was about 7 nights and 8 days.. It costed us Rs 35k…
35k is only for taxi for 8 days.

Other costs are extra. This 8 day journey is for North, south and west Sikkim. We paid Rs 2500 for taxi per day in Gangtok, that was for 8 hours.. they charge extra if you hire beyond 8 hours..

we virtually ended up paying about Rs 3300 to 3500 per day for local sight seeing bcoz we had taxi with full for full day early morning to late evening.

This complete complete journey from Gangtok to Lachen in North sikkim took us about 13 hours….

Reason it took time was bcoz we stopped for food, shoot took time plus every 30 minutes we took break to see and enjoy the beauty…

If you want to plan this journey, i will suggest you to get your bookings done properly because it involves permit.

We did this journey during last week of June 2018, which is an off season time…

Important note for this journey: 
Avoid rainy season.
Travel in either feb or March or in oct and nov to enjoy sikkim the most.

Check with your travel agent on the fact whether can travel to North sikkim or not because some of the routes are closed because of snow.

Cost for minimum low cost travel two and a half days in Gangtok will be about Rs 11000 - details in description of previous episodes of Gangtok:

Taxi cost for travel to North or other regions of Sikkim: Rs 3500 per day, for certain cost moment you are 2 people cost goes high. for example i have put 400 fare from siliguri to Gangtok for one person so you have to adjust if you are two.

Food Rs 1500
hotel: Rs 2000

For every day that you travel in Sikkim minimum cost will be Rs 7000.

North sikkim i don't think you can travel by bus, i am not sure, suggest check with some one else...but yes you can travel to other districts of sikkim by bus, check details with tourism office in MG marg Gangtok for details.

MG marg is the place which is heart of Gangtok, try taking a hotel near MG marg.

Sikkim is over all expensive, so be sure on costs bcoz your budgets can over shoot, especially if you are going in peak season. Cost that you are see are of off season, during season every thing is atleast 30 percent higher on cost...

If you have any experience of sikkim travel, do share that in comments below. I would look forward to hear back from you in this regard.
Thanks

When ready, browse vacation packages to Sydney: https://www.expedia.com/Sydney.d178312.Destination-Travel-Guides

Once a penal colony in 1788, #Sydney has since transformed into a must-visit coastal destination. Today, tourists flock to this city on the east coast of Australia for its pristine beaches, coves, and harbors. 

Explore the scenic coastline and make a stop at the Sydney Opera House and eye its magnificent architectural design. Venture over to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, nicknamed “The Coathanger,” and brave a bridge climb tour. Next, hop on the antique thrill rides at Luna Park, which is a family-friendly favorite that dates back to 1935, or saunter around Darling Harbour. Meanwhile, if you’d prefer to make a splash, dive into the waves at Bondi Beach or hang ten at nearby Manly Beach. 

Dabble in the city’s history, architecture, and beach towns, and embark on a Sydney #tour during your next #vacation to the capital of New South Wales. 

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

548,uPXNmS0IBRQ,Changing Lanes,RV Travel Day Checklist! | Full Camp Breakdown and Setup | Full Time RV | Changing Lanes!,"What's involved in the breakdown and setup of a very large fifth wheel toy hauler?  Quite a bit actually.  
⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️ Click Show More ⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️

We've got it pretty well down since we move every 10 days or so!  Camp breakdown and preparing to move is the most involved and most important (versus setting up camp).  If we forget to tie something down or secure something, it can be disastrous.  When on the move, we are 15 TONS of rig going 65mph, so everything has to be in the right place.  Hydraulic slides will crush things with ease.  So, the name of the game is CHECKLISTS!

Setting up camp is also fairly involved but once the rig is leveled, connected, and the slides are out, setup is much more leisurely than breakdown.  We can set up and unload the motorcycle, etc. as time, weather, etc permits.

This video will show you everything involved in our typical move day.  Yes, we know it's a LONG video.  But it is a long process, so we condensed it as much as we could.

There is more to Kolkata than what meets the eye.  If you have missed episode 1 of Kolkata series, you may have a look at it through Playlist.

Following are the details of the places visited by as part of this Kolkat tour.


Sharma Tea House: What an amazing kachori, completely different in taste and reasonably priced too.

I think i got little more excited after drinking kesar chai but that’s true i enjoyed the taste and chai after kachori was like beautiful start to the day.

Khasta Kachori Rs. 35
Jalebi Rs. 12
Kesar Chai Rs. 40
Address: 55C, sambhunath pandit lane, bhawanipur
Location: http://bit.do/eJvpg 

Victoria Memorial : This is a must visit place, you can spend 2 hours here and learn about the history of Kolkata. I would suggest you to go here early in morning at around 10 am, so you can go along with the first batch of guide, you don’t have to pay any extra cost for the guide.

Ticket Rs. 30 for gallery & garden 
Timings 10am to 6 pm
Monday close
Location: http://bit.do/eJvpm 


Abar Baithak: More than the taste i enjoyed the cafe ambience, though taste was also great.
Fish & Chips Rs. 290
Address: 282, jodhpur park
Location: http://bit.do/eJvpu 

Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick: I did a mistake by not visiting this shop again, i wanted to get some parcel done for taking along sweets for my home but eventually bought sandesh for my home from Airport by paying higher price,that was obvious.

I am not exaggerating by saying that if you have Jal Bhara sandesh in Kolkata you will become big fan of this sweet, Not only that but more sweets as well.

Baked Rossogolla Rs. 16 per pcs
Jalbhara Sandesh Rs. 20 per pcs
Mango Curd Rs. 28 per pcs
Address: 2, Paddapukur Road
Location: http://bit.do/eJvpF 


6 Ballygunge Place: Though cost of food at this restaurant is high but if you are comfortable paying high price for food you will be deeply impressed by the taste of Bengali food at this fine dining restaurant.

Mochar Paturi Rs. 200
Daab Chingri Rs. 525
Address: 6 ballygunge place
Location: http://bit.do/eJvpL 

Hope you enjoyed watching this Episode 2 of our Kolkata, West Bengal food and travel series.

I am deeply impressed by the West Bengal food cuisine, It will not be wrong to say that Kolkata food is underrated… There is so much more that we missed, there wasa 2 day strike in Kolkata when we were there.

We missed those 2 working days, but yes we did our best on available time.

My sincere thanks to all the subscribers of visa2explore who met me there at Kolkata and guided me on tour planning… thanks a lot for your guidance.

Thanks, regards, Harish Bali","['Kolkata food', 'Best sweet of India', 'Kolkata sweets', 'Jal Bhara sandesh', 'Bengali food', '6 Ballygunge place', 'famous sweet of kolkata', 'best Bengali food restaurant of Kolkata', 'Kolkata breakfast', 'kachori in Kolkata', 'Victoria memorial in Kolkata', 'place to eat Bengali food in Kolkata']",2019-03-13T07:00:01Z,1218449,22067,,1872,PT21M54S,true

565,8IuMf9c2_qo,visa2explore,Gangtok to Lachen Food &  Travel Journey North Sikkim | Episode 4,"This is day 4 of our Sikkim travel. North sikkim has so many waterfalls, such a beautiful journey. 

North Sikkim is one of the places to visit in Sikkim
Clouds, waterfalls, calm place and so much more during this journey, we also enjoyed amazing brunch at one of the food joints.

If you want to support this channel, please visit: https://www.patreon.com/visa2explore

Details of places visited by us is given below:

Distance between Gangtok to Lachen North Sikkim 135 Km

1.Naamsingh WaterFall 

2. Seven Sisters Waterfall
Samosa ₹10 & Tea ₹10 nearby to this Waterfall

3. We bought some Vegetables from Local Vegetable Shop for our onward journey, as advised by our Driver, you will not get these in Lachen. If you want to have Traditional food you can bought some Vegetables.

4. Country BA & Restaurant: They are really good on traditional food. Every food we had at this place was lifetime experience.

If you enjoy traditional food then this is a great place...

Fooding & Lodging
Address - Tingchim Zero, North Sikkim, 
Opp. IInd Last Petrol Pump of North Sikkim
Traditional Meal - ₹ 250

Contact number - 9002774881, 9647853099, 

There is no telecom network at this place so these numbers may not be of much help.. 

5.  Singhik View Point, Mangan

You will get to see beautiful scenic view from this point.
We went there in Monsoon weather we could not see the Mt. Kanchenjunga, otherwise from this point, Mount kanchenjunga can be seen clearly.

We did this journey through a local travel agency, its name is Tamu travels… Lalit is the owner:

Tamu Tour and travels
Development area, Gangtok east Sikkim.
http://www.tamutourandtreks.com/

9832564013
9002069916.

This journey from Gangtok to North Sikkim then west and south Sikkim for us was about 7 nights and 8 days.. It costed us Rs 35k…
35k is only for taxi for 8 days.

Other costs are extra. This 8 day journey is for North, south and west Sikkim. We paid Rs 2500 for taxi per day in Gangtok, that was for 8 hours.. they charge extra if you hire beyond 8 hours..

we virtually ended up paying about Rs 3300 to 3500 per day for local sight seeing bcoz we had taxi with full for full day early morning to late evening.

This complete complete journey from Gangtok to Lachen in North sikkim took us about 13 hours….

Reason it took time was bcoz we stopped for food, shoot took time plus every 30 minutes we took break to see and enjoy the beauty…

If you want to plan this journey, i will suggest you to get your bookings done properly because it involves permit.

We did this journey during last week of June 2018, which is an off season time…

Important note for this journey: 
Avoid rainy season.
Travel in either feb or March or in oct and nov to enjoy sikkim the most.

Check with your travel agent on the fact whether can travel to North sikkim or not because some of the routes are closed because of snow.

Cost for minimum low cost travel two and a half days in Gangtok will be about Rs 11000 - details in description of previous episodes of Gangtok:

Taxi cost for travel to North or other regions of Sikkim: Rs 3500 per day, for certain cost moment you are 2 people cost goes high. for example i have put 400 fare from siliguri to Gangtok for one person so you have to adjust if you are two.

Food Rs 1500
hotel: Rs 2000

For every day that you travel in Sikkim minimum cost will be Rs 7000.

North sikkim i don't think you can travel by bus, i am not sure, suggest check with some one else...but yes you can travel to other districts of sikkim by bus, check details with tourism office in MG marg Gangtok for details.

MG marg is the place which is heart of Gangtok, try taking a hotel near MG marg.

Sikkim is over all expensive, so be sure on costs bcoz your budgets can over shoot, especially if you are going in peak season. Cost that you are see are of off season, during season every thing is atleast 30 percent higher on cost...

If you have any experience of sikkim travel, do share that in comments below. I would look forward to hear back from you in this regard.
Thanks

First Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHNs3Vuoit8&

In this episode, we begin by teaching you the tricks to getting a sunrise photo at Moraine Lake, which can be very difficult with the crowds nowadays. After this we make our way to Moraine Lake and hike up to the beautiful Lake Agnes where Sophie relaxes while I climb up to the Big Beehive and then the Devil's Thumbs. Once we get back down, we drive on the breath-taking Icefield's Parkway and visit location like Peyto Lake, Athabasca Glacier and the Goats and Glaciers viewpoint where we watch sunset with some wild mountain goats. Then we finish off the day by finding a free stealth camping location in Jasper National Park.

These cities are located in Gilgit Baltistan, a territory in Pakistan administered Kashmir. Gilgit To Skardu distance is 200 Km. The road is under construction, usually, 5 to 6 hours takes to reach Skardu, if there are not any landslides or road blockage due to construction. I am late due to Motorbike repairing in Gilgit City. Now it seems too difficult to reach Skardu today. The Road is few meters paved then bumpy and dusty. I think two more year needs to complete this road. Gilgit Skardu Road is along the Indus River. It is one of the longest rivers in Asia. Its length is 3180 Km. It flows through western Tibet China, Ladakh India, and Pakistan.  This route was among the dangerous route in the world. Tonight will stay here. I paid 12 USD for this cabin. I am ready to go to Skardu early morning because Road will be closed between 9 am to 2  pm for construction. Fortunately, the road was open except for two spots. I waited for two hours. Today is 17 August and Potatoes are being harvested in this area. Potatoes and Peas are profitable vegetables for northern Pakistan. in Punjab, potatoes will be ready for harvest in December because I plant potatoes and peas in October.

☑️ Thailand: Has a 1 day quarantine that ends after you test negative, you can opt for a visa on arrival or e-visa and it’s a pretty solo travel friendly destination! 

☑️ Sri Lanka: You don’t need to quarantine if you are fully vaccinated. You don’t need to present a negative report either in such cases. The visa process is entirely online or can plan it as a solo workation destination as well! 

☑️ Turkey: You need a negative report within 72 hours of travelling. The visa process is online and can be applied for easily. The cost of Turkish e-visa is $48. 

☑️ Cambodia: Similar travel requirements as Sri Lanka and Turkey with regards to the quarantine period. The visa is usually processed upon arrival or can be obtained online.  The tourist visa is valid for 1 month and it’s costs $20

☑️ Indonesia: Bali is an island in Indonesia which was my first ever solo destination! No visa is required for Indian tourists if you’re visiting for lesser than 30 days. The quarantine period has been slashed to 1 day if you’re a fully vaccinated traveller, as opposed to 7 days earlier! But that is only true if you’re landing in Bali.

Hope this post helps you in travelling abroad, in the coming months! I had shot this video originally for YT shorts, but if you do like it, follow me here and save this video. 😊

P.S. How do you like my new YT Shorts backdrop?",,2022-03-17T07:50:46Z,886686,47471,,594,PT41S,false
